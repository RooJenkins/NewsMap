## Haiti

Here's what you need to know about Haiti in November 2025: the country remains trapped in a downward spiral of gang violence and humanitarian catastrophe, with over 90 percent of Port-au-Prince now under gang control. The promised international rescue mission is floundering, and the political system is essentially nonexistent.

### Major Issues

### 1. Gang Control and Security Collapse
**What's happening:**
- Gangs now control more than 90% of Port-au-Prince, according to UN estimates, essentially running a parallel state in the capital
- Between July and September 2025 alone, 1,247 people were killed and 710 injured in gang violence
- On November 8, 2025, Haiti delivered seven new armored vehicles to the Armed Forces (FAd'H) - the first since their 2017 remobilization - a symbolic gesture that underscores just how under-resourced the security forces remain
- The Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission has been integrated into a Gang Suppression Force, but it's making minimal progress against well-armed and deeply entrenched criminal networks

**Why it matters:**
- This isn't just lawlessness - it's state failure. Haiti has had no nationally elected officials since January 2023, and parliament has been inactive since 2019
- The violence has paralyzed most of the economy and made daily life for millions of Haitians a matter of survival rather than progress
- For the international community, this represents a failed intervention strategy: billions spent, multiple missions deployed, and the situation continues to deteriorate

**Prospects:**
- Elections initially scheduled for February 2026 have been delayed indefinitely - there's simply no security environment in which to hold them
- Without a functioning government or effective security forces, gangs will likely consolidate control further
- The MSS mission faces serious resource constraints and political complications, making a military solution increasingly unlikely
- Best case: a negotiated power-sharing deal that gives some gangs legitimacy in exchange for reducing violence. Worst case: complete collapse into warlordism

### 2. Humanitarian Catastrophe
**What's happening:**
- More than 1.3 million people - over 10% of Haiti's population - have been displaced nationwide, living in schools, abandoned buildings, or makeshift camps with limited access to food and clean water
- Over 64% of Haiti's 11.7 million people lived on less than $3.65 per day in 2024, and the situation has only worsened
- Half the country faces acute hunger, with food insecurity reaching crisis levels
- Basic services like healthcare and education have collapsed in gang-controlled areas

**Why it matters:**
- This is a full-spectrum crisis affecting every aspect of human development: health, nutrition, education, economic opportunity
- Children are growing up in a failed state with no access to schooling, healthcare, or even basic safety
- The scale of displacement creates conditions ripe for disease outbreaks and further violence
- Haiti sits just 700 miles from Miami - this crisis has direct implications for regional migration flows and U.S. domestic politics

**Prospects:**
- Without massive international humanitarian intervention (which seems politically unlikely), conditions will continue deteriorating
- Displacement will likely increase as gangs expand territorial control
- Food insecurity could tip into famine conditions in some areas if agricultural production remains disrupted
- The longer this persists, the more Haiti risks becoming a permanently failed state with a lost generation of children

### 3. Political Vacuum and Failed Governance
**What's happening:**
- The transitional government is tasked with restoring security, upholding the rule of law, addressing the humanitarian crisis, and preparing for elections - but it lacks the capacity, legitimacy, or resources to accomplish any of these goals
- No national elections have been held since 2016; the country has had no functioning legislature since 2019
- Political elites remain fragmented and unable to form a governing coalition
- International actors (U.S., France, Canada, UN) are providing financial and logistical support but avoiding direct intervention

**Why it matters:**
- Without legitimate governance, there's no one to negotiate with, no one to hold accountable, and no pathway to a political settlement
- The transitional government cannot deliver basic services, cannot enforce laws, and cannot provide security - the fundamental functions of a state
- This creates a dangerous precedent: in the absence of the state, criminal organizations become the de facto government
- For Haiti's neighbors and the international community, this means dealing with a territory where there's essentially no partner for diplomacy or development

**Prospects:**
- The transitional government is likely to limp along without achieving meaningful progress toward elections or security restoration
- International fatigue is setting in - donors are less willing to fund missions that show no results
- There's a real risk Haiti becomes a "frozen conflict" - not important enough for major intervention, but too destabilizing to ignore
- Any solution will require either a new international approach (perhaps regional leadership from Caribbean nations) or a homegrown political settlement that includes gang leaders

## Summary
Haiti in November 2025 represents one of the Western Hemisphere's most acute crises: a complete breakdown of state authority, humanitarian disaster, and failed international intervention. With gangs controlling the capital, 1.3 million displaced, and no functioning government, the country is trapped in a cycle of violence and deprivation with no clear exit strategy. The November delivery of armored vehicles to an under-resourced military symbolizes the gap between the scale of the crisis and the resources being deployed. For investors, policymakers, and humanitarian organizations, Haiti requires a fundamental rethinking of intervention strategies - what's been tried isn't working, and the cost of continued failure grows with each passing month.

## Honduras

Honduras heads into its November 30, 2025 elections with democracy hanging by a thread. President Xiomara Castro's administration has delivered little on its anti-corruption promises, her family's political dominance is raising eyebrows, and the Trump Administration's aid cuts and deportation policies are creating new pressures. The election looks like a three-way race, but the real story is about whether Honduran institutions can handle another contentious transition.

### Major Issues

### 1. Electoral Credibility Crisis
**What's happening:**
- Honduras holds presidential, legislative, and municipal elections on November 30, 2025, with three main candidates: Rixi Moncada (LIBRE, Castro's former defense minister), Nasry Asfura (PN, former Tegucigalpa mayor and 2021 candidate), and a third contender
- Growing mistrust of Honduran institutions is raising fears of electoral violence and contested results
- Voters are focused on three issues: economy/jobs, security/organized crime, and corruption
- Castro-aligned legislators secured control of congress through controversial means and appointed a friendly attorney general, raising questions about institutional independence

**Why it matters:**
- This election will test whether Honduras can manage a democratic transition after years of institutional erosion under Castro
- The last presidential election in 2021 was marred by allegations of irregularities; another disputed outcome could trigger serious unrest
- With institutions weakened and trust low, there's limited capacity to mediate conflicts or enforce results
- For the U.S., a destabilized Honduras means more migration pressure and potential security challenges in Central America

**Prospects:**
- Expect a close, contested election with allegations of fraud from multiple sides
- If results are disputed, street protests and potential violence are likely given the low institutional trust
- International observers will be crucial for legitimacy, but their presence alone won't prevent conflict if results are close
- Best case: a clear winner with margins too large to dispute. Worst case: razor-thin results, competing claims to victory, and violence

### 2. Castro Administration's Anti-Corruption Failure
**What's happening:**
- President Castro ran on fighting corruption but has made little concrete progress in her term
- High-level appointments of family members - including husband Manuel Zelaya (former president 2006-2009) - have undermined anti-corruption credentials
- In September 2025, Castro presented to UN Secretary-General António Guterres a second draft agreement to create an International Commission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (CICIH), but this remains in draft form
- The attorney general appointed by Castro-aligned legislators is seen as politically compromised

**Why it matters:**
- Corruption isn't just an abstract governance issue - it directly affects economic development, foreign investment, and citizen trust in democracy
- Castro's failure to deliver on her signature campaign promise hands ammunition to opposition candidates and undermines her party's electoral prospects
- Without institutional reforms, Honduras remains vulnerable to drug trafficking organizations and organized crime that thrive on corrupt systems
- For international partners, especially the U.S., this complicates aid relationships and security cooperation

**Prospects:**
- The CICIH draft agreement is unlikely to move forward before elections, and any new administration may not prioritize it
- Corruption will remain endemic regardless of who wins on November 30 - the systems that enable it are too entrenched
- Opposition candidates will run on Castro's corruption failures, but are unlikely to deliver different results given the same institutional constraints
- Real anti-corruption progress would require constitutional reforms and international oversight, neither of which seems politically feasible

### 3. Economic Pressures and Trump Administration Policies
**What's happening:**
- Honduras' GDP growth averaged 3.8% annually between 2022-2024; IMF projects 3.5% for 2025 - solid but not spectacular
- The economy heavily depends on agricultural commodity exports (coffee, bananas), low-value manufacturing (apparel), and remittances
- Remittances from abroad (85% from the U.S.) exceeded $9.7 billion in 2024 - a massive 26% of GDP
- Trump Administration terminated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Honduras on September 8, 2025, affecting 51,225 Hondurans in the U.S. since 1998 or earlier
- Trump Administration terminated $167 million in FY2024-2025 aid during its foreign assistance review
- Between January-August 2025, 19,552 Hondurans returned from the U.S. as deportees or voluntary returns

**Why it matters:**
- Remittances are the economic lifeline for millions of Honduran families - any disruption has immediate humanitarian impact
- TPS termination puts 51,225 long-term residents at risk of deportation, which would affect both their families and remittance flows
- Aid cuts eliminate programs for economic development, governance, and security - exactly the areas Honduras needs support
- Deportations strain already weak social services and can fuel gang recruitment if returnees can't find legitimate work

**Prospects:**
- Remittance flows will likely decrease if mass deportations proceed, hitting rural and poor families hardest
- Economic growth will slow without U.S. development aid, particularly in infrastructure and job creation programs
- Deportation waves could destabilize communities, increase crime, and fuel more emigration - a vicious cycle
- Castro's successor will inherit an economy more dependent on the U.S. but with less U.S. support and more Hondurans being forcibly returned

## Summary
Honduras approaches its November 30, 2025 elections as a country at a crossroads. President Castro's failure to deliver on anti-corruption promises, combined with institutional weakening and Trump Administration policies cutting aid and terminating TPS, creates a perfect storm of economic, political, and social pressures. The three-way presidential race is tight, and growing mistrust of institutions raises real concerns about electoral violence and contested results. The economy remains heavily dependent on remittances (26% of GDP) from a U.S. administration that's cutting aid and deporting Hondurans. Whoever wins on November 30 will inherit a country with weakened institutions, economic headwinds, and a population deeply frustrated with corruption and lack of opportunity. Watch this space - Honduras could either manage a credible democratic transition or slide further into instability.

## Hungary

Viktor Orban just won big in Washington. On November 7, 2025, President Trump granted Hungary a one-year exemption from Russian oil and gas sanctions after a friendly White House meeting, handing Orban exactly what he needed ahead of parliamentary elections in April 2026. For the EU and Ukraine, this is a nightmare - the bloc's most pro-Russia member just got U.S. cover to deepen energy dependence on Moscow.

### Major Issues

### 1. Trump's Russian Energy Exemption - Orban's Diplomatic Win
**What's happening:**
- On November 7, 2025, Trump and Orban met at the White House and immediately after, the U.S. granted Hungary a one-year exemption from sanctions on Russian oil and gas
- Hungary buys more Russian energy than any other EU nation: 74% of its gas and 86% of its oil came from Russia in 2024, according to IMF figures
- The exemption spares Hungary from the "violent economic shock" it was facing after Trump sanctioned two Russian oil giants last month
- Hungary committed to buying about $600 million in U.S. liquefied natural gas as part of the deal
- Orban claims the exemption could be "indefinite" despite the official one-year designation

**Why it matters:**
- This gives Orban massive political capital ahead of April 2026 parliamentary elections - he can claim he protected Hungary's economy while maintaining cheap Russian energy
- For the EU, this is a direct blow to energy security strategy: Brussels wants to phase out all Russian gas/LNG by end of 2027, but Hungary just locked in U.S. permission to keep buying
- It undermines European unity on Russia sanctions, giving Moscow a wedge to exploit within the EU
- For Ukraine, it's a betrayal - the U.S. just gave Hungary cover to continue funding Russia's war effort through energy purchases
- It signals Trump's transactional approach: Orban pays for some U.S. LNG and gets to keep Russian energy flowing

**Prospects:**
- The exemption will likely extend beyond one year if Trump remains in office - the "indefinite" framing from Orban suggests ongoing negotiations
- Hungary will leverage this to resist any EU measures to reduce Russian energy dependence
- Other EU members may seek similar deals, fracturing the united front on Russia sanctions
- Ukraine and Eastern European NATO allies will push back hard, creating new tensions within the alliance
- Orban's domestic opponents will struggle to attack this move - protecting cheap energy is popular with voters facing cost-of-living pressures

### 2. Parliamentary Elections and Peter Magyar's Challenge
**What's happening:**
- Hungary holds parliamentary elections in April 2026, pitting Orban's Fidesz party against a much younger conservative challenger, Peter Magyar
- Magyar is campaigning on the government's poor economic track record and the cost-of-living crisis affecting ordinary Hungarians
- Orban currently commands over 80% of seats in parliament, giving him near-total control of legislation
- U.S. tariffs on the EU have negatively impacted Hungary's export-dependent economy
- The Russian energy exemption hands Orban a major win just months before voters go to the polls

**Why it matters:**
- This is the first serious conservative challenge to Orban from within the right - not from liberal opposition but from someone who can appeal to Fidesz voters
- If Magyar gains traction, it could break Orban's political monopoly and open space for genuine opposition
- The cost-of-living crisis is Orban's vulnerability: rising prices, stagnant wages, and economic underperformance create real voter frustration
- However, the Russian energy deal neutralizes this weakness by promising continued cheap gas and avoiding economic shock
- For Europe, a Magyar victory would be huge - it could shift Hungary from being the EU's problem child to a more cooperative partner

**Prospects:**
- Orban enters the race strengthened by the Trump deal but still vulnerable on economic performance
- Magyar will attack corruption, nepotism, and economic mismanagement, but must overcome Fidesz's control of media and state resources
- Expect Orban to use the campaign to deepen ties with Trump and position himself as Hungary's defender against Brussels
- Magyar's best chance is if cost-of-living pressures intensify despite cheap Russian energy, but that's a tough sell
- Most likely outcome: Orban wins with reduced majority, Magyar becomes leader of a strengthened opposition

### 3. EU-Hungary Rift Over Ukraine and Russia
**What's happening:**
- Orban is alone in the EU in blocking Ukraine's accession talks and membership bid
- Hungary opposes EU Commission plans to phase out Russian gas and LNG imports by end of 2027
- Budapest maintains that cutting Russian energy would "cripple" Hungary's economy - an argument Orban made directly to Trump
- Orban told reporters in November 2025 that Hungary sees Russia as "an integral player in Europe" and plans to "derive maximum benefit" from relations with Moscow
- The EU is frustrated but unable to override Hungary's veto on key Ukraine and Russia-related decisions

**Why it matters:**
- Hungary's obstruction directly harms Ukraine's integration into European structures and sends the message that the EU isn't fully committed to Ukrainian membership
- It creates a permanent fault line within the EU between Eastern members who see Russia as an existential threat (Poland, Baltics) and Hungary's accommodationist approach
- Brussels has limited tools to discipline Hungary - Article 7 proceedings have stalled, and withholding funds hasn't changed Orban's behavior
- This rift will worsen as the war in Ukraine continues and energy security remains a top concern
- For Putin, Orban is the perfect wedge: a EU and NATO member who can block consensus and normalize relations with Moscow

**Prospects:**
- Orban will continue blocking Ukraine's EU accession as long as it serves his interests - either to extract concessions from Brussels or to maintain good relations with Moscow
- The EU will look for workarounds (enhanced cooperation, bilateral deals) but can't fully bypass Hungary's veto
- If Trump pushes for a Ukraine peace deal that favors Russia, Orban will be Trump's key ally within Europe
- Expect ongoing tension: Brussels will keep trying to isolate Hungary, Orban will keep playing spoiler
- Long-term, this could lead to EU treaty changes to eliminate unanimity requirements, but that's years away

## Summary
Viktor Orban secured a major diplomatic victory in November 2025, walking out of the White House with a one-year (potentially indefinite) U.S. exemption from Russian energy sanctions. This hands him both cheap energy for Hungarian voters and political ammunition ahead of April 2026 parliamentary elections, where he faces a credible conservative challenger in Peter Magyar. For the EU and Ukraine, this is a disaster: Hungary - already the bloc's most pro-Russia member - just got American cover to deepen energy dependence on Moscow, undermining European unity on sanctions and Ukraine's EU accession. Orban's message is clear: he's Trump's man in Europe, and he'll use that relationship to protect Hungarian interests even if it means defying Brussels, frustrating Kyiv, and angering Poland and the Baltics. Watch April 2026 - if Orban wins re-election, expect more of the same. If Magyar pulls off an upset, Hungary could return to the European mainstream.

## Indonesia

Indonesia is having a November to remember - and not in a good way. On November 10, 2025, President Prabowo Subianto posthumously named former dictator Soeharto a national hero, sparking outrage from civil society. Simultaneous regional elections revealed the extent of political dynasties, while economic growth slows and democracy concerns mount. Prabowo's first year looks increasingly like a return to authoritarian patterns dressed in democratic clothing.

### Major Issues

### 1. Soeharto Named National Hero - Historical Revisionism
**What's happening:**
- On November 10, 2025, President Prabowo Subianto - Soeharto's former son-in-law - posthumously declared Soeharto a national hero
- Soeharto ruled Indonesia for three decades (1967-1998) with a record of mass human rights violations, endemic corruption, and dynastic nepotism
- About 500 civil society members, activists, and academics published an open letter requesting Prabowo not proceed with the designation
- Prabowo ignored the opposition and went ahead with the award, signaling his willingness to defy civil society and rehabilitate authoritarian figures

**Why it matters:**
- This isn't just symbolic - it's historical revisionism that rewrites Indonesia's democratic transition and minimizes crimes committed during the New Order regime
- Soeharto's forces were responsible for the 1965-66 massacres (hundreds of thousands killed), the East Timor occupation (200,000+ deaths), and systematic corruption that looted billions
- By honoring Soeharto, Prabowo sends a chilling message: authoritarian rule can be rehabilitated, and strongman governance is respectable
- For victims' families and human rights defenders, this is a slap in the face and a denial of justice
- It aligns with regional trends toward democratic backsliding and rehabilitation of authoritarian leaders (Marcos in Philippines, military figures in Thailand)

**Prospects:**
- The designation will stand - Prabowo has the political power and seems unconcerned about domestic or international criticism
- This opens the door for further authoritarian nostalgia and mainstreaming of anti-democratic narratives
- Civil society will continue protesting, but Prabowo controls parliament (80%+ seats) and has limited accountability
- International partners (U.S., Australia, EU) face a dilemma: criticize and risk relationship, or stay silent and tacitly endorse
- Expect more symbolic moves to rehabilitate New Order figures and policies over Prabowo's term

### 2. Regional Elections and Political Dynasty Entrenchment
**What's happening:**
- Indonesia held simultaneous countrywide elections in November 2025 for provincial and regional executive offices
- Research found that 605 out of 1,551 candidate pairs (39%) were linked to political dynasties
- This reveals how deeply entrenched dynastic politics has become, with power and resources concentrated in elite families
- Elections occurred amid concerns about fairness, with Prabowo commanding 80%+ of parliamentary seats and wielding outsized influence

**Why it matters:**
- Political dynasties undermine meritocracy and concentrate power, making governance about family networks rather than competence or public service
- When nearly 40% of candidates come from political families, it signals that politics is becoming a hereditary privilege rather than democratic competition
- This reduces policy innovation and responsiveness - dynasty politicians protect family interests rather than constituent needs
- For voters, it creates disillusionment: if politics is just elite families trading power, why participate?
- It compounds inequality - political dynasties often control business interests, blurring lines between public office and private profit

**Prospects:**
- Without electoral reforms or anti-dynasty legislation, this trend will accelerate
- Prabowo himself comes from a military-political elite and has no incentive to challenge dynastic politics
- Regional governments will increasingly resemble mini-kingdoms, with governors and mayors treating offices as family businesses
- This will further hollow out Indonesian democracy, making elections procedural rather than meaningful contests
- Long-term, this risks creating permanent political aristocracy disconnected from ordinary Indonesians

### 3. Economic Slowdown and Austerity Under Prabowo
**What's happening:**
- Economic growth slowed to 4.87% in Q1 2025 - solid by global standards but below Indonesia's potential
- Prabowo's "budget efficiency measures" have effectively paused existing government projects without introducing new sources of growth
- Healthcare spending has been slashed by 18.5%, while infrastructure investment saw a massive 73% cut
- Despite economic challenges, Prabowo has faced violent protests since taking office, mainly over economic inequality and lavish perks for lawmakers
- Prabowo commands 80%+ of parliament, giving him near-total legislative control but also full responsibility for economic policy

**Why it matters:**
- Cutting infrastructure investment by 73% is staggering - this will slow long-term economic development and job creation
- Healthcare cuts hit the poor and vulnerable hardest, worsening inequality in a country where 40%+ of the population remains economically precarious
- Prabowo's efficiency measures are producing austerity without reform - projects are paused, but there's no coherent growth strategy to replace them
- Public anger over inequality and lawmaker perks shows that austerity for citizens while elites maintain privileges is politically unsustainable
- For investors, this signals unpredictability: Prabowo campaigned on development but is delivering budget cuts

**Prospects:**
- Economic growth will likely remain below 5% as infrastructure cuts limit investment and job creation
- Protests will continue and may intensify if living standards decline while elite privilege remains visible
- Prabowo may shift course if unrest grows, but his 80%+ parliamentary majority means he faces little institutional pressure
- Healthcare cuts will lead to worse public health outcomes, particularly for poor and rural populations
- Medium-term risk: economic stagnation + growing inequality + hollowed-out democracy = conditions for serious political instability

## Summary
Indonesia in November 2025 is revealing the contours of Prabowo Subianto's presidency, and the picture isn't encouraging for democrats. The posthumous naming of dictator Soeharto as a national hero signals historical revisionism and authoritarian rehabilitation. Regional elections showed that nearly 40% of candidates come from political dynasties, entrenching elite power. Economic growth is slowing as Prabowo slashes infrastructure investment (73%) and healthcare spending (18.5%) without a coherent growth strategy, while violent protests erupt over inequality and lavish lawmaker perks. With 80%+ control of parliament and a willingness to defy civil society, Prabowo has the power to reshape Indonesia - but the direction is toward democratic backsliding, dynastic politics, and economic uncertainty. For those watching Southeast Asian democracy, Indonesia's trajectory under Prabowo is a warning: procedural democracy can survive while substantive democracy withers.

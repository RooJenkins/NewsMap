    name: 'Bolivia',
    lat: -16.2902,
    lng: -63.5887,
    summary: `Bolivian entertainment operates at Latin America's margins, chronically underfunded yet culturally rich. The film industry produces perhaps two or three features annually, usually social realist dramas exploring indigenous identity, migration to cities, or coca cultivation politics. Jorge Sanjinés remains the towering historical figure—his revolutionary cinema of the 1960s-70s created a genuinely Bolivian cinematic language. Contemporary directors struggle with near-total absence of funding infrastructure. Films premiere at international festivals, win awards, then barely screen domestically. The disconnect between critical success and economic viability is stark.

Music offers more vitality. Traditional Andean music—charangos, panpipes, drums—remains culturally central, performed at festivals and protests. The hip-hop scene grows steadily, young Bolivians blending Spanish, Aymara, and Quechua lyrics over beats that reference both trap and Andean rhythms. Folkloric music evolves—groups like Los Kjarkas achieved international recognition decades ago, newer acts update the tradition. The challenge is infrastructure—limited recording studios, radio dominated by foreign music, streaming economics that make sustainable careers nearly impossible.

Television consists mostly of cheap telenovelas and news programming. The state broadcaster promotes government messaging, commercial channels operate on minimal budgets. Production values lag far behind wealthier neighbors. Bolivian television feels stuck in an earlier era, unable to compete with streaming platforms that younger urban Bolivians increasingly prefer. Gaming culture exists primarily in internet cafés where Counter-Strike and Dota 2 maintain devoted followings. Social media entertainment grows—Bolivian YouTubers create comedy and commentary, building modest audiences. The creator economy offers opportunities, though monetization remains challenging in one of South America's poorest nations.`

    name: 'Paraguay',
    lat: -23.4425,
    lng: -58.4438,
    summary: `Paraguayan entertainment operates in profound obscurity, even within Latin America. The film industry barely exists—perhaps one feature film every few years, usually made on microscopic budgets by directors who fund projects through international grants and personal savings. Paz Encina's films screen at major festivals, her meditative style finding audiences among cinephiles while remaining invisible domestically. The challenge isn't just funding but infrastructure—lack of film schools, equipment, theaters willing to screen Paraguayan work. Cinema survives as passionate individual efforts rather than functioning industry.

Music reflects Paraguay's cultural isolation and bilingualism. Guaraní-language music remains popular, particularly polca paraguaya and guaranía—distinctly Paraguayan forms that rarely travel beyond borders. The harp tradition is remarkable, Paraguay having developed unique playing styles. Contemporary music sees small rock and pop scenes in Asunción, bands singing in Spanish and Guaraní to modest audiences. Reggaeton and trap arrive late but gain traction among youth. The streaming era helps—Paraguayan artists can theoretically reach global audiences, though in practice, few break through.

Television offers telenovelas and variety shows produced cheaply for domestic consumption. SNT and Telefuturo maintain viewership without investing in quality programming that might compete regionally. Paraguayan television exists in a weird time warp, producing content that feels dated by international standards yet satisfies its intended audience. The internet provides escape—younger Paraguayans watch YouTube and Netflix rather than domestic channels. Gaming culture grows slowly, limited by economic constraints that make consoles and gaming PCs luxury items. Social media entertainment emerges—Paraguayan TikTokers and YouTubers create content in Spanish and Guaraní, finding small but devoted audiences. The creator economy offers possibilities in a nation where traditional employment often disappoints. Paraguayan entertainment persists despite everything, maintaining cultural identity through sheer will rather than institutional support.`

    name: 'Uruguay',
    lat: -32.5228,
    lng: -55.7658,
    summary: `Uruguayan entertainment punches slightly above its weight, benefiting from relatively high education levels and cultural sophistication in a tiny market. The film industry operates on limited scale but genuine ambition—films like A Twelve-Year Night and Bad Day to Go Fishing win international recognition. Directors explore Uruguayan history, particularly the dictatorship era, with subtlety that avoids didacticism. Production companies manage perhaps three to five features annually, usually through co-productions with Argentina, Spain, or international grants. The domestic market can't sustain professional filmmaking, but Uruguay's filmmakers persist through resourcefulness and international connections.

Music remains eclectic, reflecting Uruguay's position between Argentine sophistication and Brazilian vitality without fully embodying either. Candombe, the Afro-Uruguayan drumming tradition, maintains cultural significance, performed during Carnival and cultural events. Rock and pop scenes exist in Montevideo—bands like La Vela Puerca, No Te Va Gustar, and Cuarteto de Nos achieved regional success. The electronic music scene is surprisingly robust for a country of 3.5 million, with Uruguayan DJs and producers gaining international recognition. Contemporary artists blend influences freely, making music that feels cosmopolitan rather than parochially Uruguayan.

Television is dominated by Argentine and Brazilian imports, though domestic channels produce news, sports coverage, and occasional series. Canal 10 and Teledoce maintain viewership without the budgets for ambitious production. The small population makes quality television economically challenging—the audience just isn't large enough to justify major investment. Streaming platforms provide the content Uruguayan television can't afford to make. Gaming culture exists among younger, economically comfortable Uruguayans. Esports sees limited participation given the tiny player base. Social media entertainment grows—Uruguayan YouTubers and influencers create content that often targets Argentine and broader Spanish-language audiences, recognizing domestic market limitations. The creator economy offers opportunities, though most successful Uruguayan creators eventually expand beyond national borders to sustain careers.`

    name: 'Cuba',
    lat: 21.5218,
    lng: -77.7812,
    summary: `Cuban entertainment exists in surreal contradiction—a nation of extraordinary creative talent operating under extraordinary constraints. The film industry functions through ICAIC, the state film institute, which for decades produced remarkable work despite (or perhaps because of) limitations. Tomás Gutiérrez Alea's films remain classics of Latin American cinema. Contemporary Cuban directors navigate complex realities—making work that can't be explicitly political yet unavoidably reflects political circumstances. Recent films explore emigration, economic hardship, LGBTQ+ experiences in ways previously impossible. The internet's gradual arrival is transforming everything, younger filmmakers making work for festivals and streaming platforms rather than state approval.

Music is where Cuba's cultural power remains undeniable. Son, rumba, timba—Cuban music fundamentally shaped Latin music globally. The Buena Vista Social Club revival demonstrated international appetite for traditional Cuban sounds. Contemporary Cuba produces remarkable musicians working across genres—jazz, hip-hop, electronic, pop—often leaving the island to sustain careers. The reggaeton explosion owes debts to Cuban originators who rarely received credit or compensation. Today's Cuban music scene is vibrant despite economic crisis, artists performing in paladares and cultural centers, recording in makeshift studios, distributing through internet when connectivity allows.

Television remains state-controlled, offering propaganda, sports, telenovelas, and occasional quality drama. The arrival of streaming through black market and gradual legal access has transformed consumption—Cubans watch foreign content on phones and laptops, bypassing state television entirely. The generational divide is stark—older Cubans watch state TV, younger Cubans watch everything else. Gaming culture exists in limited form—internet cafés where connection permits, phones running whatever games work offline. The social media explosion has been transformative. Cuban YouTubers and TikTokers document daily life, create comedy, build audiences among the diaspora. The creator economy offers actual income in a collapsing peso economy—dollars from YouTube and Patreon represent genuine salvation. Cuban entertainment is diaspora-izing rapidly, talent leaving while those who remain navigate increasingly absurd contradictions.`

    name: 'Haiti',
    lat: 18.9712,
    lng: -72.2852,
    summary: `Haitian entertainment persists despite catastrophe, creativity surviving circumstances that would destroy most industries. The film industry is barely a whisper—occasional documentaries, rare features made with international support. Raoul Peck is Haiti's most prominent director, though his career has been international for decades. The infrastructure for filmmaking in Haiti essentially doesn't exist—chronic instability, poverty, lack of equipment and training make production nearly impossible. Yet Haitians tell stories, document their reality, make films in the interstices between crises.

Music remains culturally vital. Compas, the Haitian dance music that dominated Caribbean clubs for decades, continues evolving. Haitian artists blend traditional rhythms with hip-hop, R&B, and electronic production. The diaspora looms large—most successful Haitian musicians eventually relocate to Miami, Paris, or Montreal, maintaining connection to Haiti while basing careers elsewhere. Rap kreyòl has exploded, young Haitians making music that documents gang violence, political corruption, and daily survival. The music is raw, immediate, unpolished—recorded on phones in neighborhoods without electricity, distributed through WhatsApp and YouTube.

Television operates sporadically, stations broadcasting when generators have fuel. Programming consists of news, some local variety shows, and whatever foreign content is available. Most Haitians consume media through phones now—YouTube, TikTok, WhatsApp videos. The traditional media model has essentially collapsed. Gaming culture barely exists given infrastructural realities, though Haitians play mobile games when connectivity permits. Social media entertainment is vital—Haitian creators document life in Port-au-Prince, create comedy that processes trauma, build audiences among massive diaspora desperate for connection. The creator economy offers possibilities even in absolute chaos—a phone, creativity, and internet access can generate income in dollars when local currency has collapsed. Haitian entertainment is survival art, culture maintaining itself against overwhelming odds. The resilience is remarkable, the circumstances devastating. Creativity persists because Haitians refuse to let their culture die with their nation.`

    name: 'Dominican Republic',
    lat: 18.7357,
    lng: -70.1627,
    summary: `Dominican entertainment exports cultural influence far beyond its size, bachata and merengue having conquered global dance floors over decades. The music industry remains the crown jewel—bachata evolved from rural folk music to sophisticated urban sound, artists like Romeo Santos filling stadiums worldwide. Merengue maintains popularity despite bachata's ascendance. Contemporary Dominican artists increasingly blend genres—dembow, the Dominican variant of reggaeton, has exploded, its fast, aggressive beats spreading across Latin America and influencing reggaeton globally. The streaming era has been transformative, allowing Dominican artists to reach audiences previously inaccessible. Major labels now sign Dominican acts, recognizing the commercial potential.

Film industry remains modest but growing. The Dominican Republic serves as filming location for international productions, the infrastructure gradually developing. Domestic films tackle social realities—migration, poverty, baseball dreams, tourist economy contradictions. La Soga films brought action cinema to Dominican screens, proving domestic productions can find audiences. The challenge remains financing and distribution—the Dominican market alone can't sustain industry, requiring regional or international reach. Television is dominated by telenovelas and variety shows, production values improving as the industry matures. Reality TV thrives, particularly talent competitions seeking the next bachata star.

Gaming culture grows among young Dominicans, internet cafés hosting competitive gaming and social spaces for those unable to afford personal computers. Baseball remains the national obsession, but younger generations increasingly embrace gaming and streaming culture. Social media entertainment is massive—Dominican influencers command audiences across the Spanish-speaking world. Comedy content thrives, creators mining daily life and cultural specificity for material. Beauty and lifestyle influencers have found success, capitalizing on the Dominican Republic's beauty industry prominence. The creator economy offers opportunities in a nation where traditional employment often fails to deliver middle-class living. Dominican entertainment rides confidence born of musical success, the industry believing bigger achievements are possible if investment and infrastructure keep developing. Tourism connections provide capital and international relationships that more isolated nations lack.`

    name: 'Guatemala',
    lat: 15.7835,
    lng: -90.2308,
    summary: `Guatemalan entertainment operates in the shadows of both its Mayan heritage and contemporary violence. The film industry produces sparse but significant work—Jayro Bustamante emerged as the national cinema's most prominent voice, his films exploring indigenous identity, religious hypocrisy, and social violence with striking visual power. La Llorona and Ixcanul screened globally, demonstrating Guatemalan stories resonate beyond borders. But the industry barely exists as such—a handful of directors making films through international grants, personal networks, and determination. The domestic market provides minimal support, funding remains perpetually scarce.

Music reflects Guatemala's indigenous majority and Spanish colonial legacy. Marimba remains the national instrument, traditional music maintaining cultural significance. Contemporary music sees reggaeton and Latin pop dominating urban youth culture, the sounds indistinguishable from broader Latin trends. A small rock and alternative scene exists in Guatemala City, bands singing primarily in Spanish. The most interesting development is indigenous artists blending traditional Maya music with modern production, creating something genuinely new that honors heritage while sounding contemporary.

Television offers telenovelas, news, and cheap variety shows. Guatemalan television lags behind wealthier countries in production values and ambition. The industry exists to fill airtime rather than create culturally significant work. Many Guatemalans, particularly younger urban populations, have migrated entirely to streaming platforms and YouTube, abandoning domestic television. Gaming culture exists in internet cafés and among economically comfortable youth. The esports scene remains nascent, though Guatemalan players compete regionally. Social media entertainment grows—YouTubers and TikTokers create comedy, commentary, and lifestyle content. Many successful creators eventually target broader Central American or Latin audiences, recognizing Guatemala's market alone can't sustain professional careers. The creator economy offers escape from traditional employment's limitations, entrepreneurial opportunity in a nation where those remain scarce. Guatemalan entertainment awaits investment and infrastructure that might unlock creative potential currently constrained by economic reality and persistent violence.`

    name: 'Honduras',
    lat: 15.2000,
    lng: -86.2419,
    summary: `Honduran entertainment struggles for existence against overwhelming obstacles—chronic poverty, violence, political instability, and near-total absence of cultural infrastructure. The film industry is virtually nonexistent, occasional documentaries chronicling migration, gang violence, and social collapse. Feature films are extremely rare events made by individuals rather than an industry. The infrastructure simply isn't there—no film schools, minimal equipment, few theaters, and a population too economically stressed to support cinema. Honduran stories get told by foreign journalists more often than Honduran filmmakers.

Music offers more signs of life. Punta, the Garifuna music of Honduras's Caribbean coast, maintains cultural significance and international recognition. Cumbia and salsa dominate popular music, sounds imported from elsewhere and embraced locally. The contemporary music scene is modest—reggaeton and Latin pop played on radio and in clubs, occasional Honduran artists achieving regional recognition. The streaming era helps marginally, but Honduras hasn't produced breakout stars who capture international attention. The economic constraints are real—most Hondurans can barely afford food, spending money on music production and consumption is luxury.

Television consists of telenovelas, news, and imported programming. Honduran television operates on minimal budgets, unable to compete with Mexican and Colombian production quality. The content feels cheap because it is—stations doing their best with resources that barely exist. Gaming culture is limited to economically comfortable urban youth, internet cafés providing access for those who can afford hourly rates. Esports participation is minimal. Social media entertainment represents the most accessible form—phones are ubiquitous even in poverty, and WhatsApp videos, TikTok comedy, and YouTube content provide entertainment and connection. Honduran creators often focus on the migration experience, documenting journeys north, life in diaspora, dreams of escape. The creator economy offers limited monetization given audience economics, but any income helps. Honduran entertainment exists despite rather than because of national circumstances, culture persisting through individual will in the absence of institutional support.`

    name: 'Nicaragua',
    lat: 12.8654,
    lng: -85.2072,
    summary: `Nicaraguan entertainment operates under political repression that has intensified dramatically since the 2018 protests. The film industry barely functions—the Ortega regime views independent art with suspicion, funding is nonexistent, and many artists have fled to exile. Films that do emerge often address political themes obliquely, made in defiance of government that would prefer silence. Documentaries chronicle repression and resistance, usually filmed clandestinely and premiered abroad. The creative class has been targeted directly—journalists, artists, filmmakers imprisoned or forced to leave.

Music continues despite political oppression. Traditional marimba and folk music maintain cultural presence. Palo de Mayo, the Caribbean coast music tradition, celebrates annually despite government attempts to control all public gathering. Contemporary Nicaraguan music sees reggaeton and Latin pop dominating youth culture, sounds politically neutral enough to avoid regime scrutiny. The interesting musical work happens in diaspora—exiled Nicaraguan artists making music about homeland, repression, exile, longing. Inside Nicaragua, musicians self-censor, the consequences of political content being too severe.

Television is state-controlled or operating under government pressure, independent journalism and cultural programming essentially eliminated. Canal 4, Canal 6, and other stations toe the regime line or face closure. Many Nicaraguans, particularly younger educated populations, have abandoned domestic media entirely, consuming content through VPNs and streaming platforms. The internet remains partially free, though the government monitors and occasionally restricts access. Gaming culture exists among those who can afford it, though the economic crisis makes hardware prohibitively expensive. Social media becomes political battlefield—government trolls, opposition activists, ordinary Nicaraguans trying to communicate truth about their situation. The creator economy offers limited opportunities given economic collapse and political risk—being visible online in Nicaragua can be dangerous. Nicaraguan entertainment exists in suspended animation, waiting for political change that would allow cultural life to breathe again. The talent exists, the desire exists, but the space to create has been methodically destroyed.`

    name: 'El Salvador',
    lat: 13.7942,
    lng: -88.8965,
    summary: `Salvadoran entertainment has transformed alongside the nation's dramatic security changes under President Bukele. The film industry remains tiny but ambitious—films exploring gang violence, migration, and civil war legacy occasionally reach international festivals. Salvadoran directors tell urgent stories, the nation's traumatic recent history demanding documentation. But funding remains scarce, the domestic market can't sustain professional filmmaking, and many talented Salvadorans work in diaspora rather than home.

Music reflects El Salvador's evolution. Cumbia, salsa, and reggaeton dominate popular taste, sounds shared across Central America. The rock and punk scenes that thrived in the 1990s-2000s have diminished, though underground music continues. Contemporary El Salvador sees trap and hip-hop growing among youth, artists rapping about street life that has radically changed since gang crackdowns. The music industry remains modest—Salvadoran artists rarely break through internationally, the market is small, and resources are limited. The diaspora looms large—many Salvadoran musicians are based in Los Angeles, maintaining connection to homeland while building careers abroad.

Television offers news and imported programming, with domestic production minimal. Salvadoran television has never developed the infrastructure of larger countries, the market too small to justify major investment. Streaming platforms have captured younger audiences, domestic channels struggling to remain relevant. Gaming culture grows, particularly among youth benefiting from improved security and internet infrastructure. The safety to visit internet cafés or stay out late has expanded as gang violence collapsed. Social media entertainment explodes—Salvadoran influencers document the country's transformation, creating content about improved safety, economic opportunities, and national pride. The government actively promotes positive narratives, though independent voices persist. The creator economy offers opportunities in a nation where traditional employment often fails to provide middle-class income. Salvadoran entertainment exists in a transitional moment, the nation's dramatic changes creating space for cultural production that wouldn't have been possible during the gang violence era. Whether this translates to sustained industry development remains uncertain, but the energy and optimism are palpable.`

    name: 'Costa Rica',
    lat: 9.7489,
    lng: -83.7534,
    summary: `Costa Rican entertainment benefits from relative prosperity and political stability while struggling with small market size. The film industry produces three to five features annually, usually social dramas exploring contemporary Costa Rican life. Films like The Awakening of the Ants and Clara Sola have traveled to international festivals, demonstrating Costa Rican cinema's maturity. The challenge remains economic—the domestic audience can't sustain professional filmmaking, requiring co-productions and international grants. Costa Rica's biodiversity and natural beauty attract international productions, gradually building infrastructure that domestic filmmakers can access.

Music reflects Costa Rica's chill tropical identity. Calypso from the Caribbean coast maintains cultural significance, reggae and dancehall have deep roots in Limón province. Contemporary Costa Rica embraces Latin pop, rock, and electronic music, bands like Malpaís blending rock with traditional Costa Rican folk music. The indie and alternative scenes thrive in San José, a small but passionate community making music that rarely travels beyond Central America. Streaming platforms help Costa Rican artists reach wider audiences, though breakthrough international success remains elusive.

Television offers news, telenovelas, and variety shows, production values decent but unambitious. Costa Rican television exists in the shadow of Mexican and Colombian imports that dominate primetime. The domestic industry provides employment without inspiring creative ambition. Younger Costa Ricans increasingly abandon domestic television for streaming platforms and YouTube. Gaming culture is robust by Central American standards—relatively high incomes and good internet infrastructure support active gaming communities. Esports sees growing participation, Costa Rican teams competing regionally. Social media entertainment thrives—Costa Rican YouTubers and influencers create comedy, lifestyle, and travel content. Many leverage Costa Rica's reputation as ecological paradise, creating content about sustainability, wildlife, and ecotourism. The creator economy offers entrepreneurial opportunities in a nation that values small business and self-employment. Costa Rican entertainment operates comfortably if unspectacularly, lacking resources for major ambitions while maintaining cultural production that serves its domestic audience adequately.`

    name: 'Panama',
    lat: 8.5380,
    lng: -80.7821,
    summary: `Panamanian entertainment punches below its economic weight, the nation's prosperity not translating to cultural production. The film industry remains nascent despite occasional successes—films screening at festivals, winning awards, demonstrating potential. But sustained industry hasn't materialized, filmmaking remaining sporadic rather than systematic. Panama's identity as global trade hub and banking center hasn't fostered entertainment industry, creative talent often heading to Miami or elsewhere to pursue careers.

Music offers more substance. Panamanian reggae and reggaeton have authentic roots—reggae en español pioneered in Panama in the 1980s-90s laid groundwork for Latin urban music explosion. El General, Nando Boom, and others created sounds that influenced reggaeton's development, though Puerto Ricans and Colombians ultimately dominated the genre commercially. Contemporary Panamanian artists like Sech and Joey Montana have achieved international success, bringing Panama back into Latin music consciousness. Typical music, Panama's blend of cumbia, salsa, and reggae, remains popular locally, performed at carnivals and celebrations.

Television consists primarily of news, telenovelas, and imported programming. Panamanian television production is minimal, the industry never having developed infrastructure despite economic resources. The small population and cultural ties to United States mean many Panamanians consume American media as much as Latin American content. Streaming platforms dominate among younger audiences. Gaming culture is robust—good internet infrastructure and relatively high incomes support active gaming communities. Panamanian esports players compete regionally, though the scene remains modest in scale. Social media entertainment grows steadily—Panamanian YouTubers and influencers create content, often targeting broader Latin American audiences. Many focus on Panama's unique position—the canal, banking, international business culture, the blend of Latin American and North American influences. The creator economy offers opportunities, though Panama's relatively strong traditional economy means entertainment entrepreneurship competes with well-paying corporate jobs. Panamanian entertainment remains underdeveloped relative to national wealth, potential untapped, awaiting investment and creative vision that might transform economic prosperity into cultural production.`

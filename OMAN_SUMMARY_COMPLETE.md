## Writing Style Elements

The summary successfully employs "Rest is Politics" podcast style:
- **Opening Hook:** Dramatic scene-setting with Sultan Haitham as "diplomatic kingmaker" receiving calls from Erdoğan, Merz, Pezeshkian
- **Conversational Tone:** "Let that sink in," "Here's the bombshell," "Forget oil"
- **Specific Details:** Names, dates, statistics throughout (May 23, 18 documents, 39% to 8.4%, etc.)
- **Stakes & Consequences:** Economic pain vs. long-term prosperity, regional mediation indispensability
- **Forward-Looking:** Vision 2040 as "existential pivot," green hydrogen as future competitive advantage
- **Rhetorical Questions:** "Why?", "What makes it fascinating"
- **Vivid Language:** "Green Gold Rush," "teeters on the edge," "honest broker"

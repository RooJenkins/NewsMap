## KEY THEMES ACROSS BATCH

### System Challenges
- **Gulf States:** Oil wealth doesn't guarantee outcomes; citizenship-based employment undermines merit
- **Southeast Asia:** Access achievement masking quality concerns; exam cultures vs innovation needs
- **Pacific/Central Asia:** Geography, language diversity, legacy systems creating distinct barriers

### Common Patterns
1. **Test Scores vs Learning:** PISA performance doesn't capture creativity, innovation capacity
2. **Inequality:** Urban-rural, ethnic, class divisions reproduced through education
3. **Language Politics:** Medium of instruction becomes political/identity battleground
4. **Credential Inflation:** University expansion without quality control
5. **Teaching Quality:** Recruiting, training, retaining effective teachers universally challenging

### Voice Characteristics Maintained
- Data-driven analysis (PISA, TIMSS, literacy rates, spending)
- System-focused (not just facts, but how systems function/fail)
- Engaging narrative (political economy, trade-offs, uncomfortable truths)
- Critical but fair (acknowledges achievements while identifying failures)

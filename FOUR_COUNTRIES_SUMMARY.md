## 1. Democratic Republic of Congo

**Short Summary (Tooltip):** M23 entrenchment, peace talks, political repression

**Major Issues:**
1. M23 Rebel Entrenchment and Regional Peace Process
2. Political Repression and Democratic Backsliding
3. Humanitarian Crisis in Eastern Provinces

**Key November 2025 Events:**
- DRC and Rwanda signed US-backed Regional Economic Integration Framework (REIF) in early November
- First monitoring meeting for ceasefire verification mechanism
- M23 established inspector general office, recruited 370+ judicial officials
- Former presidential candidate Seth Kikuni sentenced to 1 year for "propagating rumors"
- Human rights defenders Jack Sinzahera and Gloire Saasita released Nov 8

**Analysis:** The DRC remains trapped between fragile peace frameworks and persistent conflict dynamics. M23's administrative entrenchment in eastern provinces, coupled with political repression in Kinshasa, creates a dangerous trajectory where neither genuine peace nor democratic reform appears imminent.

## 2. Dominican Republic

**Short Summary (Tooltip):** Growth slowdown, fiscal reform deadlock, tourism push

**Major Issues:**
1. Economic Growth Slowdown and Monetary Policy Adjustment
2. Fiscal Reform Deadlock and IMF Pressure
3. Sustainable Tourism Development and Economic Diversification

**Key November 2025 Events:**
- President Luis Abinader opened Vallejuelo roads network (Nov 1)
- Central Bank lowered monetary policy rate from 5.50% to 5.25%
- Economy growth revised down to 2.5% for 2025, projected 4-5% for 2026
- Zemi Miches All-Inclusive Resort opened (Oct 29)
- Senate president said country lacks conditions for salary indexing
- Abinader withdrew fiscal reform bill in October citing lack of consensus

**Analysis:** The Dominican Republic faces a classic middle-income trap scenario: strong recent growth creating expectations for continued prosperity, but structural reforms necessary for next development phase remain politically difficult. Abinader's withdrawal of fiscal reform despite IMF pressure highlights the tension between technocratic advice and electoral politics.

## 3. Ecuador

**Short Summary (Tooltip):** Nov 16 referendum, crime surge, democratic backsliding

**Major Issues:**
1. Constitutional Referendum and Democratic Legitimacy
2. Organized Crime Violence and State Capacity Collapse
3. Institutional Erosion and Rule of Law Crisis

**Key November 2025 Events:**
- November 16, 2025: National referendum with 4 questions including constitutional assembly proposal
- 13.9 million registered voters, nearly 119,000 troops/police deployed for security
- Ministry of Labor suspended VP Verónica Abad for "unjustified abandonment"
- Supreme Electoral Tribunal barred Jan Topic from presidential race on "confidential evidence"
- Fundamedios reported 160+ attacks on press freedom in November

**Analysis:** Ecuador stands at a crossroads between two dangerous paths: continued democratic erosion under Noboa's authoritarian security approach, or state collapse in the face of organized crime penetration. The November 16 referendum will reveal whether Ecuadorian voters are willing to trade democratic norms for promised security gains.

## 4. Egypt

**Short Summary (Tooltip):** Parliamentary elections, economic crisis, Gaza mediation

**Major Issues:**
1. Parliamentary Elections and Authoritarian Consolidation
2. Economic Crisis and External Dependence
3. Regional Diplomacy and Gaza Ceasefire Mediation

**Key November 2025 Events:**
- Parliamentary elections began November 10 for 596-seat House of Representatives
- Phase 1 results announced November 18
- Inflation at 12%, Egyptian pound lost value multiple times since 2022
- Egypt secured $57 billion in bailout deals since January 2025
- Houthi Red Sea attacks reduced Suez Canal traffic 60% since 2023
- Egypt took key role in Gaza ceasefire negotiations with Qatar

**Analysis:** Egypt exemplifies authoritarian stability built on external financial life-support and repression of dissent. The November parliamentary elections serve as window-dressing for a regime facing existential economic pressures that no amount of IMF/Gulf bailouts can solve without fundamental governance reforms Sisi is unwilling to implement.

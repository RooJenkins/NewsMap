// BENIN SUMMARY
const BENIN_SUMMARY = `# Benin

Patrice Talon isn't running again—and that alone makes Benin a West African unicorn. After two terms marked by economic miracles and democratic backsliding, Benin's cotton king-turned-president is actually stepping down in April 2026. His finance minister and right-hand man, Romuald Wadagni, is running to continue the "Alafia Vision," promising more infrastructure mega-projects and fiscal discipline. But here's the catch: opposition parties are still banned, independent media muzzled, and the electoral commission stacked with loyalists. Benin grew at 7.5% in 2025 while protests were tear-gassed. This is what "managed democracy" looks like when the GDP numbers sparkle but civil society suffocates.

## Major Issues

### 1. Talon's Exit, Wadagni's Coronation
**What's happening:**
- President Patrice Talon confirmed definitively in November 2025: "I will not be a candidate" for a third term
- Presidential election scheduled for April 12, 2026—Benin's first competitive transition since 2016
- Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni announced candidacy in October, describing himself as Talon's "natural successor"
- Wadagni, 52, served as Talon's economic architect since 2016, masterminding tax reforms and infrastructure spending
- Parliament approved National Development Vision 2060 in July 2025, replacing the Alafia Vision 2025 framework
- Vision 2060 will guide five-year development plans starting January 2026, ensuring policy continuity
- Talon accumulated $1.2 billion personal fortune through cotton conglomerate before entering politics in 2016
- Two-term constitutional limit theoretically enforced—but opposition questions whether electoral playing field is level
- Opposition parties face systematic exclusion: 2021 legislative elections saw only two parties allowed to run (both pro-Talon)
- Civil society organizations report ongoing harassment, arbitrary arrests of activists critical of government

**Why it matters:**
- Benin was once West Africa's democratic success story—stable multi-party politics, peaceful transitions, vibrant press
- Talon's decade transformed economic fundamentals: tax-to-GDP ratio increased 2+ percentage points (2022-24)
- But democratic institutions hollowed out: opposition banned, journalists jailed, electoral commission captured
- Wadagni's candidacy ensures continuity—but also means system designed by Talon will persist beyond him
- April 2026 election tests whether "managed democracy" becomes permanent feature or transitional phase
- International community (France, US, World Bank) praised economic reforms while largely ignoring democratic erosion
- Neighboring countries watching closely: can authoritarian-lite model deliver growth and stability simultaneously?
- Youth unemployment remains high despite GDP growth—benefits concentrated among elites connected to government
- If Wadagni wins (likely given structural advantages), Talon retains influence without formal power
- Benin risks becoming "Singapore model" aspiration: efficient autocracy justified by economic performance

**Prospects:**
- Wadagni will almost certainly win April 2026 election—opposition fragmented, electoral rules favor incumbents
- Post-Talon era will test whether institutions function or whether personalist rule reasserts itself
- Economic growth projected 7.1% average 2025-2027—infrastructure spending, port expansion, cotton exports
- Democratic space unlikely to expand: Wadagni benefits from current restrictions, no incentive to liberalize
- International donors face dilemma: reward economic success or punish democratic backsliding?
- Regional context matters: as ECOWAS weakens (Mali, Niger, Burkina exit), Benin's "stability" becomes more valuable
- Long-term risk: when economic growth slows, will hollow institutions withstand popular discontent?

### 2. The Economic Miracle Nobody Talks About
**What's happening:**
- Benin's economy grew 7.5% in 2024 and maintained 7.5% growth in first half of 2025
- Growth driven by transport (Port of Cotonou expansion), trade, construction, agriculture, manufacturing
- Public debt decreased to 51.6% of GDP by June 2025, down from post-COVID peak
- Fiscal deficit reached WAEMU target of 3% GDP in 2024—maintained in first half 2025
- Tax reforms digitalized collection systems, boosted revenue by 2+ percentage points GDP (2022-24)
- Government front-loaded tax policy reforms to maximize revenue without crushing private sector
- Infrastructure mega-projects: Port of Cotonou modernization, road networks, digital infrastructure
- Qatar commended Benin's "extensive economic and social reforms" during bilateral talks, citing "inclusive growth and institutional modernization"
- World Bank projects growth averaging 7.1% through 2027 despite "heightened global trade uncertainties"
- Inflation controlled, foreign reserves adequate, debt sustainability maintained

**Why it matters:**
- Benin outperforming regional peers: Nigeria stagnant, Ghana crisis-prone, Togo authoritarian without growth
- Economic model combines fiscal discipline (IMF-approved) with state-led infrastructure investment
- Port of Cotonou expansion positions Benin as logistics hub for landlocked Sahel countries
- But growth benefits concentrated: Cotonou elites prosper while rural poverty persists
- Cotton sector remains dominant—vulnerable to global price swings, climate variability
- Government narrative emphasizes "transformation" but unemployment, especially youth, remains stubbornly high
- Infrastructure spending creates jobs temporarily but doesn't address structural economic diversification
- Banking sector increasingly dominated by Talon-linked interests, raising conflict-of-interest concerns
- Economic success provides legitimacy for authoritarian practices: "growth justifies control" logic
- Benin becoming case study for authoritarian development model—efficient but exclusionary

**Prospects:**
- Growth trajectory sustainable short-term: infrastructure projects ongoing, port expansion attracts investment
- Medium-term risks: over-reliance on cotton, vulnerability to regional instability (Niger, Burkina Faso)
- Fiscal discipline likely to continue under Wadagni—he designed current framework, ideologically committed
- But infrastructure-led growth has limits: once projects completed, growth engine requires new drivers
- Climate change threatens agriculture—cotton yields vulnerable to rainfall variability, desertification
- Youth unemployment time bomb: educated graduates with no jobs increasingly restive
- Economic model requires political stability—if protests intensify, investor confidence could collapse
- Regional trade disruptions (ECOWAS fracturing, borders closing) could undermine port-centric strategy
- Long-term: Benin needs genuine private sector diversification, not just state-led mega-projects

### 3. The Democracy That Disappeared
**What's happening:**
- Benin's press freedom ranking collapsed under Talon: once regional leader, now systematically repressive
- Opposition parties effectively banned since 2019 electoral reforms raised candidacy requirements
- 2021 legislative elections: only two parties allowed to participate (both pro-government coalitions)
- Independent journalists face arrests, fines, forced closures for "spreading false news" or "inciting disorder"
- Civil society organizations report arbitrary detentions of activists, especially around election periods
- 2019 protests against electoral exclusion met with live ammunition—deaths reported, government denied
- Electoral commission (CENA) stacked with Talon appointees, lacks independence
- Constitutional Court judges appointed by president, rubber-stamp government decisions
- December 2019 constitutional reforms extended presidential immunity, limited judicial independence
- Freedom House downgraded Benin's freedom rating, citing "concerning trajectory toward authoritarianism"
- International media access restricted—foreign journalists require government approval, face surveillance
- Social media briefly shut down during 2019 protests, raising fears of future digital repression

**Why it matters:**
- Benin was textbook democratic success: peaceful power transfers (1991-2016), competitive elections, free press
- Talon's decade systematically dismantled institutional checks: parliament neutered, courts captured, press silenced
- Model mirrors Rwanda, Ethiopia under Abiy (early years): economic growth + authoritarian consolidation
- Opposition excluded from formal politics increasingly considers extra-institutional resistance
- Youth frustration growing: university students face unemployment, political exclusion, police harassment
- International community's silence emboldening: France, US prioritize stability and economic partnerships over democracy
- Precedent for other African leaders: economic performance justifies democratic rollback
- Benin risks social explosion if economic growth slows and political outlets remain closed
- Civil society resilience tested: organizations operate in shrinking space, self-censor to survive
- Long-term institutional damage: once norms erode, rebuilding trust in democracy takes generations

**Prospects:**
- Democratic space unlikely to expand under Wadagni—he benefits from current system, no incentive to liberalize
- International pressure minimal: Western donors prioritize stability, economic partnerships over governance concerns
- Youth-led protests possible if unemployment worsens or electoral manipulation too blatant
- Regional contagion risk: if Sahel instability spreads, Benin government will justify further repression as "security"
- Long-term: hollow institutions vulnerable when economic growth slows or leadership transition goes badly
- Opposition fragmented, demoralized, lacks resources or legal pathways to contest power
- Civil society organizations survive by avoiding direct confrontation—self-censorship becomes norm
- 2026 election will test limits: if Wadagni's victory too implausible, could trigger legitimacy crisis
- Benin's democratic backsliding signals broader African trend: multi-party systems without genuine competition

## International Angle

Benin is the international community's favorite uncomfortable success story. France and the World Bank celebrate economic reforms while quietly ignoring democratic erosion. The U.S. maintains military cooperation (Benin hosts regional counterterrorism training), prioritizing security partnerships over governance concerns. Qatar's November 2025 praise for "institutional modernization" reflects Gulf states' preference for stable autocrats over messy democracies. Within ECOWAS, Benin positions itself as the "responsible" member—fiscally disciplined, diplomatically aligned with Western interests—contrasting with Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso's military juntas. But this creates perverse incentives: as West Africa's regional architecture crumbles, Benin's authoritarian-lite model becomes more attractive to international partners desperate for any semblance of stability. The April 2026 election will test whether Western donors condition support on democratic standards—or whether economic performance and anti-jihadist cooperation trump everything else. Betting markets favor the latter.

## Bottom Line

Benin is building a high-growth autocracy where GDP sparkles but dissent dies quietly. Talon's April 2026 exit doesn't end his influence—Wadagni will govern using Talon's playbook, the institutions Talon captured, and the opposition Talon crushed. Economic growth of 7.5% impresses donors and silences critics, but benefits concentrate among elites while youth unemployment festers. Infrastructure mega-projects modernize ports and roads but don't replace the political freedoms that made Benin exceptional. The tragedy isn't that Benin is failing—it's succeeding at the wrong things. April 2026 will produce a "democratic" transition that cements authoritarian control, proving you can have elections without democracy and growth without freedom. For West Africa, that's the worst possible lesson.`

// BOTSWANA SUMMARY
const BOTSWANA_SUMMARY = `# Botswana

Duma Boko just pulled off Africa's shock of the year—and he did it through the ballot box. On November 1, 2024, his Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) ended 58 years of Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) rule, the longest single-party dominance in African electoral democracy. No coup, no violence, just voters tired of unemployment and diamond dependency finally saying enough. Now President Boko, 54, a Harvard-trained lawyer, is racing against expectations: double the minimum wage, renegotiate De Beers contracts, bring Starlink to the Kalahari. But diamonds still fund 80% of export revenues, and global demand is tanking. Botswana bet everything on one glittering resource—and now the new president must diversify an economy before the shine wears off completely.

## Major Issues

### 1. The Shock That Wasn't (Except It Was)
**What's happening:**
- November 1, 2024: UDC wins 36 of 61 parliamentary seats, BDP collapses to just 4 seats—its worst result ever
- Duma Boko sworn in as Botswana's sixth president, first opposition leader to hold office since independence (1966)
- Former President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat gracefully, calling Boko to congratulate him—rare in African politics
- BDP governed continuously 1966-2024, making Botswana's transition one of longest single-party electoral democracies
- Election focused on unemployment (officially 27%, youth unemployment likely 40%+), economic stagnation, diamond price collapse
- Boko's campaign pledges: double minimum wage (currently $250/month), increase social grants, create 100,000 jobs annually
- UDC coalition brings together leftist, centrist, and opposition factions—fragile unity held together by anti-BDP sentiment
- Time magazine named Boko one of 100 most influential people in 2025, citing "seismic election" and democratic model
- Regional implications: peaceful power transfer contrasts sharply with military coups in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso
- Election turnout 80%+—citizens engaged, system perceived as legitimate despite frustrations

**Why it matters:**
- Botswana was Africa's democratic exception: regular elections, peaceful transitions (within BDP), low corruption
- But 58 years of single-party rule created complacency, entitlement, disconnection from voters
- Diamond revenues funded patronage networks—BDP assumed loyalty could be bought indefinitely
- Youth unemployment explosion (educated graduates, no jobs) broke social contract: education no longer guaranteed prosperity
- Boko's Harvard Law pedigree (LLM 1995) signals technocratic governance, not populist strongman
- Election proves African voters will use ballot box when system permits—democracy works if institutions function
- Contrast with neighbors: Zimbabwe's rigged elections, Zambia's debt crisis, South Africa's coalition chaos
- International observers (African Union, SADC, EU) unanimously praised election as free, fair, transparent
- Botswana's institutional strength (independent electoral commission, professional civil service) enabled transition
- But expectations now sky-high: Boko must deliver economic transformation or face backlash in 2029

**Prospects:**
- Boko faces 100-day honeymoon, then reality sets in: campaign promises expensive, fiscal space limited
- UDC coalition fragile—ideological differences papered over by anti-BDP unity, could fracture under pressure
- BDP will regroup, exploit UDC mistakes, position itself as "adults in room" if economy struggles
- Civil service historically loyal to BDP—Boko must navigate bureaucracy without purges that damage competence
- Investor confidence initially positive: democratic transition reduces political risk, signals stability
- But delivering on minimum wage doubling, job creation requires economic growth currently absent
- Regional instability (Zimbabwe crisis, Mozambique unrest) could spill over, test Boko's security management
- 2029 election will be referendum on delivery: if unemployment unchanged, voters will punish UDC as harshly as BDP

### 2. The Diamond Dilemma: Renegotiating De Beers
**What's happening:**
- Diamonds account for 80% of Botswana's export revenues, 30%+ of GDP—economy existentially dependent
- De Beers partnership (Debswana, 50-50 joint venture) dominated since 1969, shaped Botswana's development model
- Global diamond demand collapsing: lab-grown diamonds cheaper, younger consumers prefer other luxuries
- Boko pledged to renegotiate De Beers agreements, increase Botswana's share of profits and cutting/polishing
- Currently, most rough diamonds exported for processing abroad—value-added happens in Belgium, India, Israel
- Government wants local diamond cutting industry to create jobs, capture more value chain
- De Beers already scaled back production in 2023-24 due to weak demand—Botswana's revenues falling
- Boko's campaign emphasized "fair deal"—rhetoric signals tougher negotiations without nationalizing (which would spook investors)
- Precedent: Zambia's copper renegotiations under Hakainde Hichilema—initial tensions, eventual compromises
- De Beers has monopoly expertise—Botswana needs their marketing, distribution networks, geological knowledge

**Why it matters:**
- Botswana built entire economy on single commodity—prudent management (sovereign wealth fund) bought time, not solutions
- De Beers relationship historically lopsided: Botswana provides diamonds, De Beers captures downstream value
- Youth unemployment crisis partly result of diamond sector being capital-intensive, not labor-intensive
- Renegotiation could unlock jobs (cutting/polishing employs thousands) or trigger capital flight (De Beers invests elsewhere)
- Global diamond market structurally declining—younger generations don't value diamonds like boomers did
- Lab-grown diamonds technologically indistinguishable, 1/10th price—existential threat to natural diamond industry
- Botswana lacks alternative export sectors at scale: tourism niche market, agriculture water-constrained
- Government rhetoric about "fair deal" raises expectations—if renegotiation yields little, Boko looks weak
- De Beers under pressure from Anglo American (parent company) to maximize returns—tough negotiating environment

**Prospects:**
- Boko will renegotiate, but De Beers holds leverage: they can simply reduce investment, shift to Canada, South Africa
- Likely outcome: marginal improvements (more local processing, slightly higher revenue share) marketed as victory
- Long-term diamond demand declining—no amount of renegotiation fixes structural market shift
- Botswana must diversify economy, but alternatives (solar, agriculture, tech services) require decades to scale
- Risk: tough rhetoric scares investors, triggers capital flight, worsens unemployment—political backlash ensues
- Sovereign wealth fund (Pula Fund) provides buffer—but drawing down savings signals failure, not success
- Regional precedent: Angola post-civil war tried to renegotiate oil contracts—limited success, learned to compromise
- Botswana's advantage: reputation for rule of law, contract sanctity—investors believe deals will be honored
- But diamond dependency means Botswana negotiates from weakness, not strength

### 3. The Starlink Gambit and Diversification Dreams
**What's happening:**
- Boko announced engagements with Elon Musk to extend Starlink internet access nationwide
- Botswana's internet penetration patchy—urban areas covered, rural Kalahari vastly underserved
- Affordable broadband could unlock digital economy: remote work, e-commerce, tech startups
- Government also targeting solar energy expansion—Botswana has 320+ sunny days/year, massive potential
- Medicinal cannabis and industrial hemp identified as growth sectors in Boko's first State of Nation Address (November 2024)
- Tourism promotion: Okavango Delta, Chobe National Park underutilized compared to Kenya, Tanzania
- Agriculture faces water constraints—Kalahari Desert covers 70% of country, rainfall erratic
- Boko pledged universal health coverage, increased education spending, infrastructure modernization
- Economic diversification requires investor confidence, regulatory reforms, skills training—years-long process
- Youth unemployment crisis demands immediate jobs—diversification is long-term strategy, not short-term fix

**Why it matters:**
- Botswana's diamond dependency is existential vulnerability—diversification isn't optional, it's survival
- Starlink partnership signals willingness to embrace technology, bypass traditional telecom monopolies
- Solar energy logical: abundant sunshine, falling panel costs, regional energy demand (South Africa's grid unstable)
- But infrastructure requires capital—Botswana's fiscal space limited, external debt rising
- Cannabis industry risky: regulatory uncertainty, international market volatility, social stigma
- Tourism sector employs thousands but vulnerable to global downturns (COVID collapsed revenues)
- Universal health coverage, education spending are popular but expensive—requires revenue growth currently absent
- Diversification rhetoric easy, execution hard: requires regulatory reforms, skills training, patient capital
- Youth expect immediate job creation—long-term diversification strategy won't satisfy short-term demands
- Botswana's small population (2.6 million) limits domestic market—must target export-oriented sectors

**Prospects:**
- Starlink deal likely to proceed—Musk expanding African footprint, Botswana's stability attractive
- Solar energy will expand, but becoming major exporter requires grid infrastructure, regional agreements
- Cannabis industry may develop, but unlikely to be major employment engine (capital-intensive, niche market)
- Tourism growth possible—but requires marketing, infrastructure, airlift capacity currently lacking
- Universal health coverage, education spending politically necessary but fiscally constrained
- Youth unemployment unlikely to fall quickly—diversification takes years, expectations measured in months
- Risk: if diversification efforts stall, Boko looks like all-talk-no-action, BDP resurges in 2029
- Long-term: Botswana's stability, rule of law, education levels provide foundation—but time is enemy

## International Angle

Botswana's democratic transition is the good news story Africa desperately needed. In a region marred by coups (Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Gabon), rigged elections (Zimbabwe, Uganda), and succession crises (Cameroon), Botswana proved democracy still works when institutions function. Western donors celebrated—USAID immediately engaged Boko's team, EU praised "exemplary" election, UK signaled trade partnership interest. South Africa's ANC, clinging to power through coalition, watched nervously: if Botswana voters can retire a liberation-era party, what's stopping South African voters? Regional implications matter: SADC, long dominated by liberation movements (ANC, ZANU-PF, MPLA, FRELIMO), now sees opposition parties can actually win. But international enthusiasm must translate into investment, debt relief, trade deals—or Boko's government will struggle to deliver. China, already invested in Botswana's infrastructure, will continue engaging regardless of democratic credentials. The test: will Western donors reward democratic transition with tangible economic support, or just symbolic applause?

## Bottom Line

Botswana just showed Africa what democracy looks like when it works—and now Duma Boko must show what comes after the euphoria. Fifty-eight years of BDP rule ended not with tanks but ballot boxes, proving voters will act when institutions permit. But winning the election was easy compared to what's next: double the minimum wage in an economy where diamond revenues are collapsing, create 100,000 jobs annually in a country of 2.6 million, renegotiate De Beers contracts without scaring investors into fleeing. Boko's got Harvard credentials, international goodwill, and a population desperate for change. But he's inherited an economy built on a single glittering rock, and that rock's value is plummeting. The diversification dream—solar, Starlink, cannabis, tourism—will take years to realize, and voters expect results in months. If Boko delivers, Botswana becomes the democratic development model Africa needs. If he fails, voters will punish him in 2029 as ruthlessly as they punished the BDP. Democracy is working in Botswana—the question is whether the economy will cooperate.`

// BURKINA FASO SUMMARY
const BURKINA_SUMMARY = `# Burkina Faso

Captain Ibrahim Traoré is 36, runs a country spiraling into chaos, and just mandated CCTV cameras at every gas station to fight terrorism. That's where Burkina Faso is in November 2025: 30% of territory controlled by jihadists, two million people displaced, and a military junta extending its rule until 2029 while blaming France for everything. JNIM (al-Qaeda affiliate) just killed 100+ soldiers in Djibo in May, the deadliest attack in years. Meanwhile, Burkina Faso quit ECOWAS alongside Mali and Niger, forming the "Alliance of Sahel States"—a military junta club that makes regional diplomacy impossible. Traoré promises "sovereignty" and anti-imperialist rhetoric, but his government can't protect villages 50 kilometers from Ouagadougou. This is state collapse in slow motion, broadcast on Telegram by militants who control more territory than the government admits.

## Major Issues

### 1. The Jihadist Surge Nobody Can Stop
**What's happening:**
- Militant Islamist groups control approximately 30% of Burkina Faso territory, per government estimates (independent assessments suggest higher)
- Al-Qaeda-affiliated JNIM (Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin) and Islamic State (ISGS) launched at least 42 attacks killing 10+ soldiers each in first half of 2025
- May 2025: JNIM complex attack on besieged town and military base of Djibo killed 100+ people—deadliest single incident in years
- Attacks on military barracks in Di, Diapaga, Djibo, Foutouri, Lanfiera, Solenzo, Sollé, Thiou, Yamba during 2025
- Towns like Djibo (northern Burkina Faso) under siege for years—civilian populations trapped, military supplies arrive only by helicopter
- Maçina Liberation Front, Ansaroul Islam, Katiba Hanifa (all JNIM affiliates) operate across northern, eastern regions
- Between April-September 2025, nearly 51,000 Burkinabè refugees arrived in Mali's Koro cercle, fleeing escalating violence—613 people/day
- Government propaganda claims security gains, but violence intensifying across Sahel, Centre-Nord, Est, Nord regions
- Military conscription expanded—government recruiting thousands of civilians into Volunteers for Defense of the Homeland (VDP)
- VDP fighters poorly trained, under-equipped, increasingly targeted by jihadists as soft targets

**Why it matters:**
- Burkina Faso's state authority collapsing in real time—military cannot protect civilians or secure territory
- Jihadist control not just rural periphery—groups operate within 50km of Ouagadougou, attack military convoys regularly
- Humanitarian catastrophe: over 2 million internally displaced (nearly 10% of population), camps overwhelmed
- 229,515 people displaced in first five months of 2025 alone—92% increase vs same period 2024
- Refugee flows destabilizing neighbors: Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana absorbing fleeing populations
- VDP militias accused of human rights abuses—extrajudicial killings, ethnic targeting, revenge attacks against Fulani communities
- Military junta's legitimacy based on promise to restore security—failure undermines entire rationale for power
- Jihadist groups gaining territory, recruits, weapons—momentum favors insurgents, not government
- Regional contagion: Burkina's collapse emboldens militants in Mali, Niger, northern Benin, northern Ghana
- International counterterrorism efforts (French, US) withdrawn or scaled back—Traoré expelled French forces, limited Western partnerships

**Prospects:**
- Security situation will worsen before it improves—jihadist groups territorially expanding, militarily confident
- Government lacks resources, training, intelligence to reverse insurgency—Russian mercenaries (rumored) won't change dynamics
- Humanitarian crisis deepening: displacement camps lack food, water, medical care—disease outbreaks likely
- Ethnic tensions rising: Fulani communities scapegoated as jihadist collaborators, facing VDP reprisals
- Long-term: state collapse possible if capital Ouagadougou itself becomes contested—precedent of Mogadishu, Kabul
- Regional intervention unlikely: ECOWAS fractured, Mali and Niger face own insurgencies, no appetite for military deployment
- Civilian population increasingly desperate—some join jihadists for protection, others flee to cities or neighboring countries
- Economic collapse accelerating: agriculture disrupted (farmers can't access fields), mining suspended in conflict zones
- Traoré's junta faces choice: negotiate with jihadists (political suicide) or fight indefinitely (resource exhaustion)

### 2. Traoré's Junta and the Five-Year Power Grab
**What's happening:**
- Captain Ibrahim Traoré, 36, seized power in September 2022 coup—Burkina's second coup that year (ousted Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Damiba)
- May 2024: junta announced five-year transition period, delaying return to civilian rule until 2029
- January 2025: Burkina Faso withdrew from ECOWAS alongside Mali and Niger, forming Alliance of Sahel States (AES)
- AES framed as anti-imperialist alliance—juntas accuse ECOWAS of being French puppet, prioritize "sovereignty"
- Traoré expelled French troops (November 2022), ended defense cooperation agreements, accused France of supporting jihadists
- Government increasingly authoritarian: journalists jailed, activists arrested, opposition figures exiled
- November 7, 2025: decree mandates security cameras at fuel stations, footage retained two months—framed as counter-terrorism, critics say surveillance state
- State propaganda emphasizes "progress" and "sovereignty"—reality contradicts official narrative
- Military junta suppresses dissent: protests banned, media censored, civil society organizations harassed
- Traoré cultivates populist image—young, anti-French, pan-Africanist rhetoric—but delivers no security gains

**Why it matters:**
- 2022 coup justified by security failures—Traoré promised to succeed where predecessor failed, but violence intensified
- Five-year transition means no elections until 2029—ample time to consolidate power, eliminate opposition
- ECOWAS withdrawal isolates Burkina diplomatically, economically—trade disrupted, regional cooperation collapsed
- Alliance of Sahel States (AES) is junta solidarity pact—no democratic accountability, no regional pressure for reforms
- Anti-French rhetoric popular domestically, but doesn't translate to security improvements—jihadists don't care about sovereignty speeches
- Authoritarian consolidation: Traoré eliminating dissent, creating personality cult, blaming external enemies (France, ECOWAS)
- Surveillance state emerging: CCTV mandate, digital monitoring, informant networks—Orwellian infrastructure without competent governance
- Traoré lacks legitimacy beyond coup—no elections, no mandate, no democratic accountability
- Military junta's promise of security unfulfilled—if violence continues unchecked, internal coup risk rises (Traoré could be ousted like Damiba)
- Youth initially supported Traoré's anti-French stance—but deteriorating living conditions, insecurity eroding support

**Prospects:**
- Traoré unlikely to voluntarily cede power in 2029—pattern of African military juntas is permanent rule, not temporary transition
- Authoritarian consolidation will continue: opposition crushed, media silenced, civil society intimidated
- Anti-French rhetoric exhausted as political tool—if security doesn't improve, junta needs new scapegoats
- Internal military tensions possible: junior officers frustrated by lack of progress, could launch another coup
- AES alliance fragile—Mali, Niger, Burkina all face insurgencies, economic crises, legitimacy deficits—cooperation limited to rhetoric
- International isolation deepening: ECOWAS sanctions lifted after withdrawal, but diplomatic, economic ties severed
- Russia courted as alternative partner (replacing France)—but Russian mercenaries unlikely to succeed where French military failed
- Long-term: Traoré governs over shrinking territory, deteriorating economy, suffering population
- Risk: popular uprising if living conditions collapse further—but security forces will violently suppress protests

### 3. The Humanitarian Catastrophe the World Ignores
**What's happening:**
- Over 2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs)—nearly 10% of Burkina's population of 22 million
- 229,515 people (36,826 households) displaced in first five months of 2025—92% increase vs 2024
- IDP camps overwhelmed: insufficient food, water, sanitation, medical care—malnutrition rising, disease outbreaks likely
- April-September 2025: nearly 51,000 Burkinabè refugees fled to Mali—613 people per day crossing border
- Refugees arrive in Mali's Koro cercle (Bandiagara region), itself unstable—creating secondary displacement pressures
- Humanitarian access severely restricted: aid organizations cannot reach conflict zones, government bureaucracy delays permits
- Schools closed in conflict zones—1 million+ children out of school, entire generation missing education
- Healthcare system collapsed in northern, eastern regions—hospitals looted, medical staff fled, maternal/child mortality rising
- Food insecurity critical: agriculture disrupted (farmers cannot access fields), markets closed, supply chains broken
- Malnutrition rates spiking among children—stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies
- Gender-based violence rising in IDP camps, conflict zones—women, girls face sexual violence, exploitation
- Ethnic tensions in displacement camps: Fulani communities blamed for jihadist violence, face discrimination, attacks

**Why it matters:**
- Humanitarian crisis is massive, under-reported—international media attention focused elsewhere (Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan)
- Displacement at current pace unsustainable—host communities exhausted, resources depleted, tensions rising
- Lost generation of children: no education, no security, traumatized—future recruitment pool for jihadists or bandits
- Malnutrition, disease, lack of healthcare creating long-term public health disaster—effects will persist decades
- Refugee flows destabilizing neighbors: Mali, Niger, Benin, Ghana face own challenges, cannot absorb unlimited influx
- Humanitarian funding insufficient: UN appeals underfunded, donor fatigue, competing crises (Sudan, DRC) draw resources
- Government prioritizes military spending over humanitarian response—junta sees security as solution, ignores human suffering
- Ethnic scapegoating of Fulani communities fueling inter-communal violence—risk of ethnic conflict overlaying jihadist insurgency
- Women, children disproportionately affected: sexual violence, exploitation, trafficking increasing in chaos
- Long-term: displaced populations cannot return home (homes destroyed, land occupied by militants)—displacement becoming permanent

**Prospects:**
- Displacement will continue increasing—violence intensifying, no realistic prospect of return for IDPs
- Humanitarian crisis will deepen: funding gaps, access restrictions, government obstruction
- Malnutrition, disease will claim thousands of lives—especially children under five, pregnant/lactating women
- Education system collapse creates lost generation—effects visible in labor force, governance for decades
- Ethnic tensions will escalate: scapegoating of Fulani communities risks ethnic violence, complicating conflict further
- Regional refugee pressures unsustainable: neighbors will close borders, push refugees back (refoulement)
- Humanitarian organizations may withdraw: insecurity, bureaucratic obstacles, funding shortfalls make operations untenable
- International community will continue ignoring crisis—media attention elsewhere, donor fatigue, no strategic interest
- Long-term: humanitarian catastrophe on scale of Somalia 1990s, DRC 2000s—but without international intervention

## International Angle

Burkina Faso is where the West's Sahel strategy collapsed and nobody knows what comes next. France's withdrawal (Traoré expelled them) ended decades of military cooperation—Operation Barkhane fought jihadists, but also propped up unpopular regimes. Now Traoré courts Russia: mercenaries rumored (though unconfirmed), propaganda support evident, arms deals likely. But Wagner Group (now Africa Corps) stretched thin (Libya, CAR, Mali), unlikely to reverse jihadist momentum. The U.S. scaled back: drone bases closed, counterterrorism partnerships reduced—Washington prioritizes China competition over Sahel stabilization. ECOWAS is fractured: Burkina, Mali, Niger withdrew, forming Alliance of Sahel States—leaving coastal countries (Ghana, Benin, Togo) exposed to jihadist spillover. The UN lacks mandate or resources for intervention. China maintains economic interests (mining) but won't deploy troops. Result: Burkina Faso fights alone, loses slowly, and drags the region down. The international community watches, shrugs, and moves on.

## Bottom Line

Burkina Faso is collapsing, and Captain Traoré's junta has no answers. Jihadists control 30% of territory and expanding, two million people displaced and desperate, 100+ soldiers killed in single attacks while the government mandates CCTV cameras at gas stations. Traoré seized power promising security, delivered speeches about sovereignty instead. Quitting ECOWAS, expelling the French, forming the Alliance of Sahel States—it's all performance art while villages burn and civilians flee. The humanitarian catastrophe is massive but invisible: international media ignores it, donors are exhausted, neighbors close borders. This isn't a temporary crisis—it's state collapse in slow motion, and there's no rescue coming. The tragedy is predictable: a military junta that can't fight, a population that can't escape, and a region that's running out of places to hide. Burkina Faso is the Sahel's warning sign—and everyone's looking away.`

// CAMEROON SUMMARY
const CAMEROON_SUMMARY = `# Cameroon

Paul Biya is 92 years old, just "won" his eighth presidential term with 53.66% of the vote, and opposition supporters are dead in the streets. October 27, 2025: Constitutional Council declares Biya victorious, protests erupt, armed forces kill at least four demonstrators, and Cameroon's succession crisis becomes a legitimacy crisis. The Anglophone regions—where separatists have killed 6,000+ civilians since 2016—allegedly gave Biya 86% of the vote, a statistical miracle in territories he can't control. His main opponent, Tchiroma Bakary, got 35% nationwide, and the opposition is screaming fraud. Meanwhile, separatist militias killed nine government soldiers before the election, kidnapped and executed a ruling-party MP after. This is Cameroon's endgame: an elderly autocrat clinging to power while the country fractures along linguistic, regional, and generational lines. The only question is whether Biya leaves in a coffin or a coup.

## Major Issues

### 1. The Election Nobody Believes
**What's happening:**
- October 27, 2025: Cameroon's Constitutional Council declares Paul Biya winner with 53.66% of vote, opponent Tchiroma Bakary 35.19%
- Biya, 92, secures eighth presidential term—has ruled Cameroon since 1982 (43 years)
- Protests erupted immediately in Douala, Yaoundé, Bafoussam—opposition calls results "rigged," demands recount
- Security forces crackdown killed at least four opposition supporters, dozens injured, hundreds arrested
- International observers (African Union, SADC) conspicuously silent—no statements affirming election credibility
- Opposition parties rejected results before official announcement—exit polls, tallies from party agents showed different outcome
- Electoral commission (ELECAM) controlled by Biya appointees, lacks independence—history of manipulating results
- Key opposition figures, including Maurice Kamto (2018 challenger), prevented from running due to administrative obstacles
- Voter turnout officially 65%—opposition claims suppression, intimidation reduced participation, especially in Anglophone regions
- Regional allies (France, US) issued weak statements urging "calm" without endorsing results—diplomatic speak for skepticism

**Why it matters:**
- Biya's legitimacy evaporated years ago—election results implausible, process fundamentally compromised
- At 92, Biya is world's oldest head of state (after Queen Elizabeth's death)—succession crisis inevitable, but no plan
- Ruling CPDM party (Cameroon People's Democratic Movement) historically monopolized power—no democratic transition ever occurred
- Youth population (median age 18.5 years) frustrated: unemployment, corruption, gerontocracy blocking opportunities
- Protests signal eroding fear: citizens increasingly willing to confront security forces despite repression
- International community's silence enabling: France maintains military ties, US prioritizes counterterrorism cooperation
- Crackdown sets precedent: Biya will violently suppress dissent to cling to power—body count rising
- Stolen election legitimizes extra-institutional resistance: if ballot box is meaningless, why participate peacefully?
- Succession crisis unresolved: Biya refuses to designate heir, key regime figures maneuvering for post-Biya power
- Cameroon drifting toward post-electoral violence: opposition energized, youth mobilized, government intransigent

**Prospects:**
- Biya will cling to power until death or coup—voluntary resignation impossible, legitimacy irrelevant to him
- Protests will continue intermittently, security forces will crush them—death toll will rise
- Opposition fragmented, lacks unity or viable strategy—regime exploits divisions, co-opts figures
- International community will accommodate Biya—stability prioritized over democracy, counterterrorism partnerships maintained
- Succession struggle intensifies within regime: military, intelligence, ruling party factions positioning for post-Biya era
- Risk of military coup rising: younger officers frustrated by stagnation, humiliation in Anglophone regions
- If Biya dies in office, power vacuum risks chaos—no institutional mechanism for transition, factions will fight
- Long-term: Cameroon's governance crisis deepens, legitimacy deficit undermines state authority
- Youth radicalization likely: if peaceful change impossible, violence becomes rational strategy

### 2. The Anglophone War That Never Ends
**What's happening:**
- Anglophone crisis began 2016: English-speaking lawyers, teachers protested imposition of French-speaking judges, administrators
- 2017: government security forces violently cracked down, protests turned into armed separatist insurgency
- Since late 2016: at least 6,000 civilians killed by government forces and separatist fighters—Human Rights Watch estimate
- As of February 2025: over 500,000 internally displaced in Anglophone North West and South West regions
- Separatist militias enforced election boycott—voter turnout among lowest in country in Anglophone regions
- Official results claim Biya won 86.31% in North West, 68.79% in South West—statistically implausible given separatist control
- Month before election: separatists attacked, killed nine government soldiers
- Day after election: separatists kidnapped ruling-party MP in North West, executed him three days later
- Government controls urban centers (Bamenda, Buea)—countryside dominated by separatist groups (Ambazonia Defense Forces, others)
- Separatists fragmented into multiple factions—some pursue independence, others seek autonomy, coordination limited

**Why it matters:**
- Anglophone crisis is existential threat: 20% of population in open revolt, government cannot militarily suppress them
- Linguistic division maps onto historical grievances: Anglophone regions former British trust territory, feel marginalized by Francophone-dominated government
- Violence spiraling: government atrocities (village burnings, extrajudicial killings) fuel separatist recruitment
- Separatists also commit abuses: kidnappings, killings of "collaborators," forced taxation of civilians
- Humanitarian catastrophe: 500,000 displaced, schools closed, healthcare collapsed, economy destroyed
- Government refuses meaningful negotiations: Biya rejects federalism, autonomy demands, insists on military solution
- Separatists fractured, lack unified negotiating position—even if government willing, who would negotiate?
- Regional spillover: Nigerian border porous, fighters, weapons, refugees flow across
- Election results claiming overwhelming Biya support in Anglophone regions insult reality—no one believes it
- Separatists openly preferred opposition candidate Tchiroma—saw him as more likely to negotiate than Biya

**Prospects:**
- Anglophone conflict will continue indefinitely—neither side can win militarily, neither will compromise politically
- Government lacks resources, will, competence to defeat separatists—military demoralized, corruption endemic
- Separatists cannot expel government from cities, achieve independence—international community won't recognize Ambazonia
- Humanitarian crisis will deepen: displacement rising, education generation lost, economic collapse
- Ethnic tensions rising: Francophone Cameroonians increasingly resentful of Anglophone "troublemakers," Anglophones feel abandoned
- Post-Biya succession could open negotiation window—or trigger intensified violence if hardliners seize power
- International mediation (UN, Switzerland attempted) failed—both sides distrust external actors, prefer military solutions
- Long-term: Anglophone regions becoming ungovernable—state authority evaporating, warlordism emerging
- Risk: if government collapses centrally (post-Biya chaos), Anglophone separatists declare independence unilaterally

### 3. The Succession Crisis Everyone Knows Is Coming
**What's happening:**
- Paul Biya, 92, visibly frail—public appearances rare, rumors of health issues persistent
- No designated successor, no institutional transition plan—Biya's strategy is "after me, the deluge"
- Key regime figures positioning for post-Biya power: Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh (Secretary-General), Joseph Beti Assomo (Defense Minister), others
- Ruling CPDM party internally divided: Francophone elites dominate, Anglophone, northern factions marginalized
- Military factions aligned with different regime figures—risk of intra-elite violence if succession disputed
- Biya's inner circle elderly, out-of-touch—average age of cabinet ministers 65+, disconnect from youth population
- Opposition parties weak, fragmented, systematically repressed—cannot capitalize on succession moment
- Youth population frustrated, unemployed, radicalized—but lack organized political outlet
- Regional powers (France, Nigeria) have stakes: France wants stability, Nigeria fears refugee flows, separatist contagion
- Civil society organizations, activists systematically harassed, arrested, silenced—cannot pressure regime

**Why it matters:**
- Biya's death or incapacitation triggers power vacuum—no constitutional mechanism ensures orderly transition
- Succession struggle could turn violent: factions within regime, military, ruling party will compete for control
- Risk of military coup: younger officers frustrated by gerontocracy, humiliation in Anglophone war, corruption
- Youth population excluded from power—succession struggle among elderly elites ignores demographic reality
- Opposition lacks capacity to contest power—decades of repression, co-optation, fragmentation left them impotent
- Anglophone crisis complicates succession: separatists will exploit chaos, intensify attacks
- Neighboring countries fear instability spillover: Nigeria, Chad, Gabon face own challenges, cannot absorb Cameroon's collapse
- France faces dilemma: support regime continuity (stability) or back democratic transition (legitimacy)?
- Economic crisis looming: oil revenues declining, debt rising, youth unemployment exploding—next leader inherits disaster
- Cameroon could follow Côte d'Ivoire (2010-11 civil war) or DRC (Kabila succession violence) trajectory

**Prospects:**
- Biya will die in office—he will never voluntarily resign, succession unplanned
- Post-Biya succession will be chaotic: regime factions will compete, military may intervene, violence likely
- Opposition too weak to capitalize on transition moment—regime continuity more likely than democratic opening
- Anglophone separatists will exploit chaos, intensify insurgency—could declare independence if central authority collapses
- Youth uprisings possible: frustration channeled into protests, riots, potentially revolutionary moment
- Regional powers will intervene: Nigeria, France may back preferred candidates, exacerbating tensions
- Risk of state failure: if succession struggle prolonged, institutions collapse, economy implodes
- Long-term: Cameroon's trajectory depends on who emerges from succession struggle and how
- Worst case: prolonged power struggle, military coup, Anglophone independence, state fragmentation

## International Angle

Cameroon's crisis is the one nobody wants to talk about. France maintains military cooperation, economic ties—Biya studied in France, speaks perfect French, is "their guy" in Central Africa. But Paris knows Biya's reign is ending and has no succession plan—backing continuity risks backing chaos. The U.S. prioritizes counterterrorism: Cameroon fights Boko Haram in the north, hosts regional military exercises—Washington won't jeopardize cooperation over election fraud. Nigeria watches nervously: Anglophone separatists could inspire Biafran movements, refugee flows strain border states. The African Union is silent—too many member states face similar legitimacy deficits, nobody wants precedent of condemning rigged elections. The UN dispatched mediators for Anglophone crisis—failed, withdrew, now pretends it's not happening. China maintains economic interests (infrastructure, minerals)—doesn't care about governance. Result: international community tacitly accepts Biya's kleptocracy because the alternatives (succession chaos, Anglophone independence, jihadist expansion) seem worse. Cameroon is too big to fail, too broken to fix, and too useful to abandon.

## Bottom Line

Cameroon is a 92-year-old autocrat, a rigged election, and a secessionist war nobody can end. Paul Biya just "won" his eighth term while opposition supporters bleed in the streets and Anglophone separatists execute government MPs. The election results are fiction—86% in regions the government doesn't control, protests crushed by live ammunition, international observers saying nothing. The Anglophone war has killed 6,000 civilians since 2016, displaced 500,000, and there's no end in sight: the government can't win militarily, separatists can't win politically, and neither will compromise. Meanwhile, Biya's succession crisis looms: no heir, no plan, just elite factions positioning for the power grab when he finally dies. Cameroon is fracturing—linguistically, regionally, generationally—and nobody's fixing it. France wants stability, the U.S. wants counterterrorism partners, Nigeria wants contained chaos. The international community has decided: Biya's kleptocracy is preferable to the unknown. For Cameroon's youth, it's a different calculation: if elections are meaningless and the old man never leaves, what's left except violence? The answer is coming, and it won't be peaceful.`

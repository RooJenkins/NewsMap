    name: 'Costa Rica',
    lat: 9.7489,
    lng: -83.7534,
    summary: "Costa Rica's infrastructure reflects a middle-income country that has prioritized education and healthcare over physical systems, creating imbalances where human capital exceeds roads and utilities. The country abolished its military in 1948, theoretically freeing resources for development, yet infrastructure investment has not matched needs. The mountainous terrain of the central valley where most Costa Ricans live makes infrastructure expensive, while the coasts that attract tourism have seen more investment. Traffic congestion in San José has become legendary despite the city's modest size, reflecting inadequate road infrastructure and absent rail transit. However, renewable energy infrastructure represents a success - Costa Rica generates nearly 100% of electricity from hydro, wind, geothermal, and solar sources.\n\nThe highway network's main routes connect San José to Caribbean and Pacific coasts with reasonable quality, though maintenance issues plague secondary roads. The Pan-American Highway through Costa Rica handles heavy traffic including international trucks but suffers from congestion and deterioration. Mountain roads require constant maintenance against landslides and weather damage. During rainy seasons, routes can wash out, cutting off communities. The recent concession of Route 27 to the Pacific port created a modern toll highway, though fees are controversial. Overall, the road network barely keeps pace with growing vehicle ownership and tourism demands.\n\nSan José suffers from severe traffic congestion despite a metropolitan population under 3 million. The city has no metro or light rail, depending entirely on buses and private vehicles. The urban geography - a central valley surrounded by mountains - creates natural constraints, but infrastructure planning has been inadequate even within those limits. Buses operate on congested streets without dedicated lanes or signal priority. The government has long discussed commuter rail or metro options but implementation has not occurred. The congestion costs the economy hundreds of millions annually in lost productivity and wasted fuel while reducing quality of life.\n\nRailway infrastructure barely exists - some tourist trains to Caribbean coast and limited commuter service, but no comprehensive network. Costa Rica once had railways connecting regions, but most infrastructure was abandoned as roads became the priority. The absence of rail options means all passenger and freight transport depends on highways, contributing to congestion and environmental impacts. The short distances involved might not justify high-speed rail, but commuter rail for the central valley and freight rail to ports could provide value.\n\nPort infrastructure at Puerto Limón on the Caribbean and Puntarenas on the Pacific serves international trade, particularly agricultural exports. Limón has been expanded with private concessions improving container handling, though labor disputes periodically disrupt operations. Infrastructure quality has improved but bottlenecks persist. The Pacific port at Caldera supplements Puntarenas for certain cargo. Cruise tourism has driven investment in terminal facilities that accommodate large ships.\n\nJuan Santamaría International Airport in San José provides good international connectivity with modern terminals. The airport serves large tourism flows efficiently. Regional airports in Liberia and other areas support tourism with adequate infrastructure. Domestic aviation infrastructure is limited as the country's small size makes most destinations reachable by road.\n\nEnergy infrastructure represents Costa Rica's greatest success - nearly 100% renewable electricity from diversified sources including hydro, geothermal, wind, and solar. The infrastructure required significant investment over decades, but Costa Rica now exports clean energy credentials internationally while reducing import dependence. However, the transportation sector still runs on imported oil, and electrification of vehicles requires infrastructure that is only beginning. The grid infrastructure serves most of the country reliably, though rural areas sometimes face service gaps.\n\nDigital infrastructure provides good coverage in cities and tourist areas with 4G and expanding fiber optic networks. However, rural areas have connectivity gaps that limit opportunities. Internet costs are moderate and penetration is reasonable for the region. The government has promoted digital infrastructure as important for competitiveness.\n\nWater infrastructure in San José and other cities faces challenges from aging systems, growing demand, and inadequate wastewater treatment. Some areas receive intermittent service or depend on wells. The central valley's aquifers are being depleted faster than recharge. Coastal tourism zones have infrastructure to support resorts but nearby communities may lack adequate service.",

    name: 'Panama',
    lat: 8.5380,
    lng: -80.7821,
    summary: "Panama's infrastructure centers on the Canal, the country's economic foundation and one of history's greatest engineering achievements. The Canal expansion completed in 2016 enables passage of larger ships, maintaining competitiveness in a changing shipping industry. The infrastructure around the Canal - ports, logistics facilities, roads connecting the transoceanic route - receives investment that reflects its economic importance. However, this creates disparities where Canal-adjacent infrastructure is world-class while other regions lag significantly. Panama City has seen dramatic growth and infrastructure development, with a metro system and modern highways, while rural indigenous areas lack basic roads and utilities. The challenge is using Canal revenues to develop infrastructure that serves all Panamanians rather than just the logistics corridor.\n\nThe highway network's main routes connect Panama City to Costa Rica via the Pan-American Highway and to Colón on the Caribbean via the Canal corridor. These routes have seen substantial investment with good quality highways. However, infrastructure east of Panama City toward Darién province is minimal, with the Pan-American Highway famously interrupted by the Darién Gap. This infrastructure absence isolates eastern Panama and prevents road connections to South America. Rural roads in other regions vary from adequate to barely passable. The highway infrastructure serves urban areas and the Canal corridor well but leaves rural populations underserved.\n\nPanama City's infrastructure has been transformed by rapid growth and investment. The Panama Metro, opened in 2014 and expanded with additional lines, provides modern rail transit that was the first metro system in Central America. The system reduces congestion and provides efficient mobility, though coverage remains limited to certain corridors. The ongoing expansion will gradually serve more of the metropolitan area. Bus rapid transit on exclusive lanes supplements the metro. However, traffic congestion remains problematic as car ownership increases faster than transit expands. The urban waterfront has seen massive development with high-rise construction requiring substantial infrastructure for utilities and transport.\n\nRailway infrastructure exists primarily for the historic Panama Railway running parallel to the Canal, now used for tourist excursions and limited commuter service. Freight rail infrastructure was rebuilt to move containers between Pacific and Atlantic ports efficiently. However, broader passenger rail infrastructure beyond the metro and this corridor doesn't exist. The country's small size and geography may not justify extensive rail infrastructure beyond what exists.\n\nPort infrastructure at both ends of the Canal handles massive container volumes. The ports of Balboa on the Pacific and Cristóbal on the Caribbean, along with newer facilities, rank among the busiest in Latin America. The infrastructure is modern and efficient, operated by international companies. The ports serve not just Panama but transshipment for the region. The infrastructure quality matches world standards, driven by the competitive shipping industry. However, the benefits concentrate in these zones while other coastal areas have minimal port infrastructure.\n\nTocumen International Airport in Panama City functions as a major regional hub, with Copa Airlines using it as a base for connecting flights throughout the Americas. The infrastructure has been expanded repeatedly to handle growing traffic, with modern terminals and capacity to accommodate future growth. Regional airports have minimal infrastructure beyond basic facilities. The aviation sector's success reflects Panama's geographic position and the business-friendly policies that enabled Copa's growth.\n\nEnergy infrastructure uses primarily hydro and thermal generation, with the grid serving urban areas reliably but rural communities sometimes lacking access. The Canal's operations require substantial electricity, influencing infrastructure priorities. Solar and wind potential exists but remains underexploited. Rural electrification has expanded but gaps persist, particularly in indigenous territories.\n\nDigital infrastructure in Panama City provides excellent fiber optic and mobile coverage. However, rural areas and indigenous territories have limited connectivity. The disparity mirrors broader infrastructure inequality. The government has promoted digital infrastructure expansion, but implementation in remote areas faces geographic and economic challenges.\n\nWater infrastructure in Panama City has been improved to serve the growing population, though some areas still face service gaps. The Canal operations require managing water resources carefully, creating tensions between Canal needs and domestic water supply during droughts. Rural areas often lack piped water, depending on wells or streams.",

    name: 'Jamaica',
    lat: 18.1096,
    lng: -77.2975,
    summary: "Jamaica's infrastructure reflects an island economy where tourism drives investment in coastal resort zones while Kingston and rural areas receive less attention. The country's mountainous spine creates natural barriers that make infrastructure expensive - roads must wind through dramatic topography, and connecting the north and south coasts requires either coastal routes or challenging mountain crossings. The economic challenges that have plagued Jamaica for decades, including high debt burdens and slow growth, have left limited resources for infrastructure investment. Recent highway projects and airport upgrades show improvement, yet basic infrastructure serving most Jamaicans remains inadequate. Traffic congestion in Kingston, unreliable electricity, and water service gaps persist despite the country's middle-income status.\n\nThe highway network has improved substantially with the North-South Highway providing better connectivity across the island's mountainous center. However, many roads remain narrow, winding two-lane routes that make travel slow and sometimes dangerous. The coastal roads around the island vary from adequate to poorly maintained. Rural roads can be in poor condition, with potholes and deteriorated pavement common. During hurricane seasons, roads and bridges wash out, sometimes taking extended periods to repair. The mountainous terrain makes maintenance expensive and ongoing, yet budget constraints mean work is often deferred.\n\nKingston's urban infrastructure struggles with traffic congestion on roads inadequate for vehicle volumes. The city has no metro or rail transit, depending entirely on buses, route taxis, and private vehicles. The transport system is largely informal, with various operators running competing services without coordination. Traffic jams waste hours daily for commuters. The aging infrastructure includes water systems that provide intermittent service to some areas and sewage infrastructure inadequate for the population. Kingston Harbour receives pollution from inadequate wastewater treatment. The infrastructure deficits constrain quality of life and economic efficiency.\n\nRailway infrastructure once connected regions but has been abandoned entirely. No passenger or freight rail service operates, and tracks have been removed or left to decay. The island's size and topography might not justify major rail infrastructure, but the absence eliminates an option that could reduce highway dependence and provide efficient connectivity between major towns.\n\nPort infrastructure at Kingston handles most international cargo with reasonable efficiency, though the facility faces competition from other Caribbean transshipment hubs. Cruise tourism infrastructure has been developed at various ports to accommodate large ships. However, cargo port infrastructure requires ongoing investment to maintain competitiveness. Montego Bay has port facilities serving tourism and some cargo. The infrastructure serves economic needs but could be more efficient with better hinterland road and rail connections.\n\nAirport infrastructure has seen substantial investment with the expansion of Montego Bay's Sangster International Airport and Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport. The facilities serve the crucial tourism industry adequately, though modernization continues. Regional airports have minimal infrastructure. The aviation sector's functionality reflects its importance for an island economy dependent on tourism and diaspora connections.\n\nElectricity infrastructure operates unreliably, with outages common and electricity costs among the world's highest. Generation relies on imported oil, making power expensive and environmentally costly. The transmission and distribution infrastructure suffers from high losses, both technical and from theft. Investment in renewable energy has been limited despite Jamaica's solar and wind potential. The high electricity costs burden businesses and households while infrastructure inefficiency compounds problems.\n\nDigital infrastructure provides 4G coverage in populated areas with expanding fiber optic networks in cities. However, rural mountain communities have limited connectivity, and costs are high relative to incomes. Internet penetration lags developed countries, though mobile phone usage is widespread.\n\nWater infrastructure provides service to most urban areas, though reliability varies. Kingston and other cities face supply challenges during dry periods, with rationing sometimes necessary. Rural areas may have limited or no piped water infrastructure. Wastewater treatment infrastructure is inadequate, with environmental impacts on coastal waters and harbors.",

    name: 'Trinidad and Tobago',
    lat: 10.6918,
    lng: -61.2225,
    summary: "Trinidad and Tobago's infrastructure has been developed through oil and gas revenues that provided resources other Caribbean nations lack. The economy's energy sector wealth enabled highway construction, industrial zones with modern utilities, and airport facilities serving both business and tourism needs. However, the infrastructure priorities have favored industry over public needs, and oil wealth didn't translate to metro systems or world-class water infrastructure that revenues might have supported. Port of Spain suffers traffic congestion despite the country's small population. Industrial estates have reliable power while residential areas face outages. The decline in energy revenues as oil fields mature creates fiscal pressure just as aging infrastructure requires replacement and upgrading.\n\nThe highway network includes the Solomon Hochoy Highway and Churchill-Roosevelt Highway connecting Port of Spain to southern industrial areas and the airport. These routes are generally well-maintained and provide adequate connectivity. However, local roads can be congested and poorly maintained. The small size of the islands means distances are short, yet traffic congestion in Port of Spain and other urban areas wastes time and fuel. The mountainous northern range creates topographic barriers that infrastructure must navigate, limiting route options. Tobago has more basic road infrastructure with some routes deteriorating from maintenance deficits.\n\nPort of Spain's urban infrastructure includes no metro or rail transit despite being a capital serving a metropolitan area approaching 500,000. Buses and maxi-taxis provide public transport, but the system is informal and uncoordinated. Traffic congestion worsens as vehicle ownership increases, yet infrastructure investment in transit alternatives has been minimal. Water infrastructure provides intermittent service to many areas, with residents storing water in tanks against supply interruptions. The indust infrastructure in Pt. Lisas and other zones has prioritized utilities for petrochemical and manufacturing facilities, creating disparities where industrial areas have excellent infrastructure while residential communities receive less investment.\n\nRailway infrastructure is essentially absent - Trinidad once had railways but they were abandoned decades ago. No passenger or freight rail service operates. The island's size likely doesn't justify major rail infrastructure, though the absence limits options for reducing highway congestion and providing mass transit.\n\nPort infrastructure serves both cargo and energy export needs. Point Lisas handles LNG exports and petrochemical products with specialized facilities. Port of Spain handles containers and general cargo with adequate infrastructure, though efficiency could improve. The ports support the country's trade-dependent economy, but infrastructure hasn't been modernized to match technological advances in global shipping.\n\nPiarco International Airport in Trinidad provides good international connectivity with modern terminal facilities. Crown Point Airport in Tobago serves tourism and inter-island connections with adequate infrastructure. The aviation sector functions well, reflecting the importance of connectivity for an island nation with substantial business travel from the energy sector.\n\nElectricity infrastructure benefits from abundant natural gas that fuels power generation, making Trinidad and Tobago's electricity costs among the Caribbean's lowest. The grid serves most of the country, though outages still occur. The infrastructure prioritizes industrial zones where reliable power is crucial for petrochemical and manufacturing operations. However, residential areas sometimes face service gaps. The dependence on gas creates future vulnerability as reserves decline and the global energy transition affects demand for fossil fuel exports.\n\nDigital infrastructure provides good 4G coverage with fiber optic networks in urban areas. Internet penetration is higher than most Caribbean countries, and speeds are reasonable. However, rural areas have coverage gaps, and costs, while lower than some neighbors, remain high for average incomes.\n\nWater infrastructure serves most areas but reliability is inconsistent. The Water and Sewerage Authority faces challenges from aging pipes, insufficient treatment capacity, and losses from leaks. Many residents depend on stored water in tanks because supply is irregular. Wastewater treatment infrastructure is inadequate, with environmental impacts on coastal waters.",

    lat: 4.8604,
    lng: -58.9302,
    summary: "Guyana's infrastructure reflects a country whose small population and dispersed settlements across vast, difficult terrain create enormous challenges. The coastal plain where most Guyanese live has basic infrastructure, while the interior remains largely inaccessible by road. Georgetown, the capital, struggles with infrastructure that hasn't kept pace with needs - drainage systems inadequate for heavy rains, roads deteriorating, and utilities unreliable. The recent offshore oil discoveries promise revenues that could transform infrastructure, yet questions persist about whether resources will be invested wisely or follow patterns of underinvestment and waste seen elsewhere. The infrastructure needs are enormous - connecting interior regions, modernizing coastal systems, building climate-resilient drainage - while governance capacity to execute major projects remains uncertain.\n\nThe highway network along the coast connects Georgetown to agricultural regions and neighboring Suriname, but quality is often poor with potholes and deteriorated pavement. The East Bank Demerara highway to the interior has sections that flood during rains. Roads into the interior are largely absent - communities in the Amazon rainforest interior are accessible only by air or river. The absence of road infrastructure limits economic development and government service delivery to interior populations. Coastal roads face flooding threats as sea levels rise and drainage infrastructure proves inadequate. Maintenance budgets are insufficient, so deterioration outpaces repairs.\n\nGeorgetown's urban infrastructure reflects colonial-era systems that were never adequate and have degraded substantially. The drainage and irrigation infrastructure, essential for a coastal city below sea level, requires constant pumping and maintenance that often fails to occur. Flooding during heavy rains or high tides can be severe, damaging property and disrupting activity. Roads deteriorate from flooding and inadequate drainage. The city has no modern public transit - minibuses provide service informally. Traffic congestion has worsened as vehicle ownership increases. Water infrastructure provides intermittent service with many residents storing water against supply interruptions. Sewage infrastructure is minimal with open drainage channels and limited treatment.\n\nRailway infrastructure is absent - Guyana once had limited rail for sugar estates but no current rail service exists. The absence means all transport depends on roads or air, limiting options as the country seeks to develop.\n\nPort infrastructure at Georgetown handles limited international cargo with basic facilities that require modernization. The Demerara River provides deep water access, but port infrastructure and operations are inefficient by regional standards. Efficiency improvements could reduce costs for a country dependent on imports for most manufactured goods.\n\nCheddi Jagan International Airport provides international connectivity with basic but adequate facilities. Interior airports are often dirt airstrips with minimal infrastructure, yet they provide crucial connectivity where roads don't exist. Domestic aviation infrastructure enables government and mining company access to remote regions despite minimal facilities.\n\nElectricity infrastructure operates unreliably with frequent outages. Generation uses imported oil, making power expensive. The grid serves coastal areas but coverage is limited in the interior. Guyana has abundant hydro potential that remains largely undeveloped - the Amaila Falls project has been discussed for years but financing and implementation remain uncertain. Solar potential exists but infrastructure deployment has been minimal. The country's forest resources could support biomass generation, yet infrastructure development has been limited.\n\nDigital infrastructure provides mobile coverage in coastal urban areas but interior regions have minimal connectivity. Internet speeds are slow and costs high relative to incomes. Fiber optic infrastructure is limited. The government has discussed digital infrastructure expansion, but implementation faces challenges from dispersed populations and difficult terrain.\n\nWater infrastructure in Georgetown and coastal towns provides piped water to some areas, though service is often intermittent. Interior communities largely depend on wells or rivers. Wastewater treatment infrastructure is minimal, with environmental and health impacts from inadequate sanitation.",

    name: 'Suriname',
    lat: 3.9193,
    lng: -56.0278,
    summary: "Suriname's infrastructure challenges reflect a small country with limited resources attempting to serve a dispersed population in challenging geography. The coastal plain where most Surinamese live has relatively functional infrastructure, while the interior rainforest regions remain largely inaccessible by road. Paramaribo, the capital, concentrates most modern infrastructure, creating stark disparities between urban and rural infrastructure access. The highway network along the coast provides basic connectivity, but interior regions have essentially no roads, with rivers serving as primary transport routes. Recent Chinese investment has funded some highway projects, though questions about terms and implementation quality persist. The small economy limits resources available for infrastructure, yet the government's prioritization of projects affects what gets built versus what's needed.\n\nThe highway network consists primarily of paved roads along the coast connecting major towns. The East-West Highway linking Paramaribo to French Guiana and Guyana represents a major connectivity improvement, enabling overland trade that was previously impossible. However, the road network remains limited, with many rural communities accessible only by boat or air. The interior regions, covering much of the country's territory, have essentially no road infrastructure, with rivers serving as primary transport routes. This infrastructure absence isn't merely inconvenient - it fundamentally constrains economic development and government service delivery to interior populations. Indigenous and Maroon communities in the interior remain isolated by infrastructure deficits that perpetuate marginalization.\n\nParamaribo's urban infrastructure is adequate for a small capital but shows signs of underinvestment and poor maintenance. The road network within the city functions but requires ongoing repair. Traffic congestion, while not severe by global standards, is worsening as vehicle ownership increases without corresponding infrastructure investment. Public transit consists primarily of minibuses operating informal routes, with no formal bus system or rail transit. For a city of under 250,000, this may be adequate, though it leaves lower-income residents dependent on informal transport systems. Water infrastructure provides piped service to much of the city, though reliability varies. Sewage treatment infrastructure is limited, with environmental impacts on waterways.\n\nRailway infrastructure is absent for passenger service - Suriname once had limited rail for bauxite transport but no passenger or broad freight rail network exists. The absence means all transport depends on roads where they exist, or boats and planes where roads don't reach.\n\nPort infrastructure at Paramaribo handles the country's maritime trade, but facilities are dated and limited in capacity. The Suriname River provides deep water access, but port infrastructure requires modernization to handle contemporary shipping efficiently. For a country dependent on commodity exports - gold, oil, bauxite - port efficiency directly affects economic competitiveness. Investments have been discussed but implementation has been slow. The absence of modern port infrastructure adds costs to trade.\n\nJohan Adolf Pengel International Airport provides international connectivity, with direct flights to Amsterdam, Miami, and regional destinations. The airport infrastructure is functional but dated, requiring investment in terminal facilities and runway infrastructure. For a country with limited road access to interior regions, domestic aviation should be crucial, yet airport infrastructure in interior towns is minimal - often just basic airstrips with limited facilities. The infrastructure that exists enables some connectivity, but expansion could improve access.\n\nElectricity infrastructure is concentrated in coastal areas, with power generation from oil and hydroelectric sources. The Afobaka Dam provides renewable energy, but the grid has limited reach into rural areas. Many interior communities depend on diesel generators for electricity, when available at all. Power outages occur regularly, even in Paramaribo, reflecting infrastructure that requires ongoing investment. The small size of the electricity market makes it difficult to achieve economies of scale, keeping costs high and limiting investment resources. Oil revenues have provided some fiscal capacity, but infrastructure investment hasn't always been prioritized.\n\nDigital infrastructure has developed moderately, with mobile coverage in coastal urban areas and 4G networks available in Paramaribo. However, internet penetration remains relatively low, and costs are high by international standards. Interior regions have limited or no connectivity, further marginalizing these populations. Fiber optic infrastructure is limited, with most internet connectivity through legacy copper networks or wireless systems.\n\nWater infrastructure in coastal cities provides piped service to most formal areas, though informal settlements may lack connections. Interior communities largely depend on wells or rivers. Wastewater treatment is limited, with environmental impacts on rivers and coastal waters.",

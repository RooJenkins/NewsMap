const summary = `The South China Sea isn't just heating up—it's boiling over. On November 5, 2025, at the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. delivered one of his sharpest public rebukes of Beijing yet. With Chinese Premier Li Qiang sitting just meters away, Marcos condemned China's "dangerous maneuvers" and "coercive actions" in Philippine waters, specifically calling out Beijing's audacious move to declare Scarborough Shoal—a feature the Philippines has controlled for decades—as a Chinese nature reserve. "This has long been part of Philippine territory," Marcos declared, his voice carrying the weight of a nation tired of being pushed around. Just days earlier, the U.S. and Philippines had announced the formation of Task Force-Philippines, a joint military command designed to boost operational cooperation and interoperability in the South China Sea. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr., meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in Malaysia, made clear that Manila is done playing defense. Meanwhile, back home, the Marcos-Duterte political civil war is threatening to undermine the very security strategy Marcos is trying to build. It's a perfect storm: external pressure from Beijing, internal political chaos, and an economy struggling to hit its growth targets.

**The Big Issue 1: China's Grey Zone Warfare and the Battle for Scarborough**

The South China Sea confrontation has entered a new, more dangerous phase in 2025. Throughout the year, Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly—most recently near Thitu Island, where Philippine forces maintain a small garrison. But it's China's November declaration of Scarborough Shoal as a "nature reserve" that represents the boldest escalation yet. The shoal, located just 124 nautical miles from the Philippine coast, has been a flashpoint since 2012 when Chinese forces seized control during a tense standoff. Marcos' public condemnation at the ASEAN Summit marked a diplomatic turning point—gone is the quiet diplomacy of previous years, replaced by direct confrontation. The formation of Task Force-Philippines signals that Manila is betting on American muscle to counter Chinese pressure. Chinese experts wasted no time firing back: a report released in early November accused the Marcos administration of "extremism and adventurism" in its South China Sea policy, claiming Manila is destabilizing the region. The reality on the water tells a different story. Chinese coast guard vessels regularly use water cannons, dangerous maneuvers, and physical blocking tactics to prevent Philippine ships from resupplying their troops and fishermen. It's classic grey zone warfare—aggressive enough to assert control, calibrated enough to stay below the threshold of armed conflict. For Marcos, the stakes couldn't be higher: retreat means losing sovereign territory; escalation risks a shooting war the Philippines cannot win alone.

**The Big Issue 2: The Marcos-Duterte Feud and the Impeachment Saga**

If China wasn't enough of a headache, Marcos is fighting a brutal political war at home against his former running mate, Vice President Sara Duterte. The alliance that won them power in 2022 has spectacularly imploded, and the fallout is dominating Philippine politics heading into November 2025. The breaking point came in late November 2024, when Duterte, during a bizarre livestreamed press conference, claimed she had contracted someone to assassinate Marcos, his wife, and House Speaker Martin Romualdez if she herself were killed. "This is not a joke," she warned. The threat triggered a constitutional crisis. By February 2025, 240 House lawmakers—an overwhelming majority—signed an impeachment complaint charging Duterte with corruption, plotting assassination, involvement in extrajudicial killings tied to her father's drug war, and incitement to insurrection. She became the first vice president in Philippine history to be impeached. But the Supreme Court threw a wrench into the proceedings in July, ruling that the impeachment violated the constitution's "one-year bar" rule. As of November 2025, the Court is poised to decide whether to uphold or reverse that controversial ruling. Meanwhile, the Marcos-Duterte feud isn't just political theater—it's actively undermining national security. According to Chatham House analysts, the two leaders' disagreements over how to handle Beijing have paralyzed coherent policymaking on the South China Sea. Duterte and her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, favor a softer approach to China; Marcos has chosen confrontation backed by U.S. military support. The result is a fractured government sending mixed signals at the worst possible time.

**The Big Issue 3: Economic Slowdown and the Inflation Dilemma**

While political drama dominates headlines, the Philippines' economic engine is sputtering. Third-quarter 2025 GDP growth came in at just 4%—down from 5.5% in Q2 and the slowest pace since Q2 2022. The year-to-date average of 5% is well below the Marcos administration's target range of 5.5% to 6.5%. The slowdown comes as global headwinds—sluggish Chinese demand, protectionist trade policies, and geopolitical uncertainty—batter export-oriented economies across Asia. There's a silver lining: inflation has cooled dramatically. After aggressive rate hikes by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to combat the post-pandemic price surge, inflation is projected to average just 1.6% in 2025 according to the IMF, rising to 3.2% in 2026—right in the middle of the BSP's target band. Headline inflation hit 2.5% in November 2024, bringing the year's average to 3.2%, a manageable level after the pain of 2022-2023. Marcos is betting on structural reforms to jump-start growth. The CREATE MORE Act, designed to attract foreign investment by improving the business climate, is the administration's centerpiece economic initiative. The goal: position the Philippines as a top destination for companies diversifying away from China. The 6.326 trillion peso national budget for 2025 is another lever, with Marcos personally reviewing agency allocations to close gaps and accelerate infrastructure spending. But challenges loom. Weather disturbances—typhoons and droughts—continue to hammer agricultural production. The banking sector remains stable, and public debt is manageable, but the economy needs stronger private consumption and investment to hit its targets. With political instability draining energy and focus, the economic outlook for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026 is uncertain.

**The International Angle**

The Philippines has become a critical frontline state in the U.S.-China competition for influence in the Indo-Pacific. The creation of Task Force-Philippines, announced at the November ASEAN defense ministers' meeting, is Washington's clearest signal yet that it views Manila as a key partner in countering Chinese expansionism. For the Biden administration's successors, the Philippines offers nine military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)—strategic locations that could prove vital in any Taiwan contingency. But Marcos is walking a tightrope. While he's embraced the U.S. alliance more tightly than any Philippine leader since the 1990s, he can't afford to completely alienate Beijing. China remains the Philippines' largest trading partner, and Chinese investment is critical for infrastructure development. Marcos' mantra—"a friend to all, enemy to none"—reflects this balancing act, even as his actions tilt decisively toward Washington. Regional dynamics add complexity. ASEAN unity on the South China Sea is a myth; several member states prioritize economic ties with China over collective security. Marcos' vocal stance at the Kuala Lumpur summit was notable precisely because it broke the usual ASEAN consensus of vague statements and studied neutrality. The Marcos-Duterte feud has international implications too. Uncertainty about Philippine policy continuity makes it harder for the U.S. and regional partners to plan long-term strategies. If Duterte returns to power—or if her allies regain influence—Manila's approach to China could shift dramatically, potentially undoing Marcos' security gains.

**The Bottom Line**

The Philippines in November 2025 is a country caught between rising external threats and deepening internal divisions. Marcos has chosen confrontation with China and partnership with the U.S., betting that American backing will allow Manila to defend its territorial claims without triggering war. But his domestic political position is fragile. The Duterte impeachment saga is far from over, and the feud is poisoning the wells of governance at a time when unity is critical. Economic growth is lagging, and while inflation is under control, the structural reforms needed to boost competitiveness will take years to bear fruit. Watch for the Supreme Court's decision on the Duterte impeachment—it could reignite political chaos or provide a temporary reprieve. Watch for the next confrontation in the South China Sea—one miscalculation could turn a grey zone clash into a shooting incident. And watch the U.S.-Philippines alliance: if Washington wavers, Manila's tough stance on China becomes untenable overnight. Marcos is playing a high-stakes game, and the margin for error is razor-thin.`

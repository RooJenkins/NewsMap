  // 1. AFGHANISTAN
  {
    name: 'Afghanistan',
    lat: 33.9391,
    lng: 67.7100,
    summary: `Don't come to Afghanistan. Not now. The Tourism Ministry—abolished by the Taliban in 2021 because "tourism is un-Islamic"—used to count 20,000 annual visitors. November 2025: that's near zero. U.S. State Department: "Do not travel." Taliban control everything, ISIS-K attacks throughout 2024-25, foreigners are kidnapping targets worth ransoms. What you're missing: Bamiyan Valley where 6th-century Buddha statues stood (Taliban dynamited them 2001) haunts against the Hindu Kush peaks. Herat's Friday Mosque with blue tilework, the ancient 65-meter minaret of Jam (UNESCO site, middle of nowhere), Wakhan Corridor where snow leopards roam the Pamir Mountains. Could be a trekking paradise—Band-e-Amir's turquoise mountain lakes, Panjshir Valley's orchards and peaks. But Taliban banned women from working (no female guides, guesthouses run by men only), enforce medieval dress codes, forbid music in restaurants. Economy collapsed—22.9 million need humanitarian aid, hotels shuttered, tourism is zero. Only foreigners: UN staff, NGO workers flying in/out of Kabul, and reckless YouTubers documenting "Taliban's Afghanistan." Infrastructure is non-existent for tourism. Kabul: Serena Hotel survived 2022 attack but who wants to stay there under Taliban checkpoints? Guesthouses outside have no electricity, water, Wi-Fi. Flights unreliable (Kam Air, Ariana Afghan—old Soviet-era jets). Roads: IEDs still risk, Taliban checkpoints demanding "road taxes," bandits in remote areas. No tourism board, visitor centers, or English signs. Spring and autumn theoretically best weather, but academic point in a war zone. Visa is absurd joke: no tourist visas exist, only business/journalist requiring Afghan sponsor invitation (takes weeks if approved, $200+ in bribes). Kabul airport arrival: non-English speaking Taliban officers demanding bribes for unclear reasons. Women traveling alone: forget it—Taliban won't allow it. LGBT: death penalty. Safety is extreme risk: kidnapping for ransom (foreigners worth $100K+), ISIS-K targets hotels/guesthouses (2024 attacks in Kabul), Taliban arbitrary detentions. Tourism's economic impact: 0% of GDP. Taliban economy runs on opium production, smuggling, and international aid. Bamiyan tourism plans abandoned when Taliban returned. Hidden gems completely inaccessible: Wakhan (no permits available), Panjshir (military-controlled zone after resistance), Balkh's ancient Buddhist sites (ISIS-K active). **Bottom line:** Afghanistan is closed for tourism under Taliban rule. Extraordinary beauty—some of Asia's most dramatic mountains and ancient Silk Road history—locked behind a regime that views outsiders as threats and women as property. Stay home unless you're a conflict reporter with death wish. Maybe someday, but not in this decade.`,

  // 2. ALBANIA
  {
    name: 'Albania',
    lat: 41.3275,
    lng: 19.8187,
    summary: `Albania is having its moment and it knows it. 10.2 million visitors in 2024 (up from 7.5M in 2023), tourism revenue hitting €4.1B, and the Albanian Riviera is Instagram-famous as the "last affordable Mediterranean paradise." November 2025: Tirana's Blloku district buzzing with Italian weekenders, Ksamil's beaches packed with Kosovars, and UNESCO threatening to de-list Butrint ruins due to overtourism damage. Prime Minister Edi Rama bet Albania's future on tourism—visa-free access for 120+ countries (Americans, EU, Chinese get 90 days free), massive coastal infrastructure spending (new airports in Vlora and Saranda planned), and marketing blitzes positioning Albania as "Greece without the crowds or prices." It's working. Too well, maybe. The Riviera—Saranda, Himara, Dhermi, Ksamil—is the crown jewel. Turquoise Ionian water, white-sand beaches, cliffside villages where locals grill fresh fish for €15, family hotels for €50/night. It's a fraction of Greece or Croatia prices: rental car €150/week, full seafood dinner €20, hotel €30-200 depending on luxury. But the dark side is showing: rampant overdevelopment with illegal concrete hotels destroying coastlines, environmental degradation (plastic-choked beaches, raw sewage), and prices rising so fast that locals are being priced out of their own towns. Can Albania scale tourism sustainably, or will it repeat the mistakes of Spain and Greece—concrete jungles replacing character? Infrastructure is improving but uneven. Tirana is surprisingly vibrant: Skanderbeg Square, Enver Hoxha's painted buildings (former dictator's regime turned into rainbow city by artist mayor), Bunk'Art museums in Cold War nuclear bunkers mixing history and contemporary art, nightlife rivaling Belgrade. Hotels range €30-200, food from cheap qofte (meatballs) and byrek (phyllo pie) to high-end fusion. Transport is easy: Bolt works, cheap buses connect cities. The Riviera: Saranda is overdeveloped but convenient (ferry to Corfu, Greece in 30 min); Himara and Dhermi still laid-back with beach bars; Ksamil calls itself "Albania's Maldives" for its crystal-clear water but gets mobbed in summer. Inland offers what most tourists miss: Berat and Gjirokastër are UNESCO Ottoman towns with white stone houses cascading down hills; Albanian Alps (Theth and Valbona valleys) are hikers' paradise with Dolomites-level peaks, shepherd trails, and mountain guesthouses. Transport: furgons (minibuses) are cheap but slow; renting a car is better but roads have hairpin turns and potholes; no rail network. English is widely spoken in tourist areas, less in villages. Food is underrated: grilled meats, fresh seafood, fërgesë (peppers, tomatoes, cheese), raki (grape brandy), surprisingly good wine. Safety is generally good—violent crime low (2.3 per 100K, below U.S. rate). Petty theft is risk in Tirana and beach resorts. Scams: taxis overcharging, restaurants adding mysterious fees, hotels with photos not matching reality. Organized crime controls construction and smuggling but doesn't target tourists. Driving is chaotic (8.3 road deaths per 100K, Europe's worst). Beach safety: no lifeguards, rip currents cause drownings. LGBT: Tirana is tolerant, rural areas not so much. Women solo: catcalling and staring but not dangerous. Visa is minimal hassle—120+ countries get visa-free 90 days (Americans, EU, Canadians, Australians). E-visas available for Pakistan, India, Egypt ($35, week processing). Fly into Tirana (TIA)—budget carriers like Wizz Air and Ryanair connect 50+ European cities (London to Tirana: €30 round-trip). Overland from Greece, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia is easy. Best time: May-June and September-October (warm, fewer crowds, lower prices). July-August is peak chaos (packed beaches, prices double, 35°C heat). Winter is dead (hotels closed, mountain roads impassable, gray skies in Tirana). Alps are best June-September for hiking; skiing emerging at Brezovica but underdeveloped. Tourism contributes 21% of GDP, employs 300K (1 in 4 workers), brings €4.1B annually. Government targets 12M visitors and €6B by 2027, banking on EU membership. But reckoning is coming: Riviera being destroyed by overdevelopment, mafia-connected construction, environmental neglect. UNESCO warning about Butrint is canary in coal mine. Himara locals report land prices tripling, rents unaffordable, traditional life destroyed. Hidden gems vanishing: Gjipe Beach (formerly boat-access only) now has bars and ATV tours; Theth (remote mountain village) has 50+ guesthouses, overrun in summer. Next tourism wave: north coast (Shkodra, Lake Koman ferry, Accursed Mountains), cultural tourism in Ottoman towns. **Bottom line:** Albania is Europe's best value right now—beaches, mountains, history, food at 1990s Mediterranean prices. But go soon because the secret's out, crowds are coming, and development is wrecking the Riviera. Want unspoiled? Head to the Alps or north coast. Want beaches? Ksamil is becoming the next Mykonos (minus the price, for now). Albania is racing toward EU membership by 2030, and tourism is the golden ticket—even if it means selling the country's soul.`,

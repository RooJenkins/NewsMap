  { name: 'Cuba', lat: 21.5218, lng: -77.7812, summary: `Cuba's criminal justice system operates under single-party communist rule where judicial independence is nonexistent and courts serve the Cuban Communist Party's interests. Crime rates are officially low—the homicide rate around 4-5 per 100,000—though data reliability is questionable given state control. The real "crime" from the regime's perspective is political dissent. Activists, journalists, and protesters face arrest on charges like "enemy propaganda," "public disorder," or "contempt," receiving prison sentences after trials that violate due process. The July 2021 protests led to mass arrests—over 1,000 detained, hundreds sentenced to lengthy prison terms including minors. The judiciary rubber-stamps government prosecutions. Corruption exists despite socialist rhetoric—officials embezzle, extort bribes, and exploit their positions. Prisons are harsh; political prisoners face isolation, beatings, and denial of medical care. The San Isidro Movement and Ladies in White activists document systematic repression. Cuba's criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice; it maintains authoritarian control.` },
  { name: 'Cyprus', lat: 35.1264, lng: 33.4299, summary: `Cyprus's criminal justice system functions as a European democracy in the government-controlled south, with independent judiciary, low corruption, and professional police. Crime rates are very low—homicide around 0.8 per 100,000. The main challenges are money laundering (Cyprus was a favored destination for Russian and Middle Eastern illicit funds until EU pressure forced reforms), human trafficking for sex work, and the unresolved Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus creating jurisdictional complications. The "Golden Passport" scandal—selling citizenship to wealthy foreigners, some with criminal backgrounds—exposed corruption at high levels, leading to the program's cancellation and prosecutions. The judiciary handles cases professionally, though court delays exist. Prisons meet European standards. Police generally respect rights, though occasional brutality cases involving migrants emerge. Northern Cyprus operates a separate system under Turkish Cypriot administration, not internationally recognized. The system in the south works well but faces challenges integrating EU anti-money laundering standards and addressing past passport corruption.` },
  { name: 'Czechia', lat: 49.8175, lng: 15.4730, summary: `Czechia's criminal justice system operates as a functional European democracy with independent judiciary, moderate crime, and relatively low corruption compared to post-communist neighbors. The homicide rate is approximately 0.6 per 100,000—among Europe's lowest. Organized crime includes drug trafficking (particularly methamphetamine production and distribution), prostitution networks, and cigarette smuggling. Corruption exists, especially in public procurement and at local government levels. High-profile cases like the prosecution of former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš for EU subsidy fraud demonstrate some accountability, though he was ultimately acquitted, raising questions about elite impunity. The judiciary is independent but faces public distrust and concerns about political appointments. Police are professional but occasionally accused of excessive force, particularly against Roma minority. Prisons meet basic European standards though overcrowding exists. The system functions adequately but requires addressing corruption more aggressively, reducing court backlogs, and ensuring equal treatment for marginalized Roma communities.` },
  { name: 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', lat: -4.0383, lng: 21.7587, summary: `The DRC's criminal justice system has collapsed amid decades of conflict, corruption, and state failure. Crime includes mass atrocities—armed groups commit massacres, sexual violence as a weapon of war, child soldier recruitment, and forced labor. The eastern provinces (North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri) remain conflict zones where over 120 armed groups operate. The formal judiciary barely functions outside Kinshasa. Courts lack resources, judges are unpaid or accept bribes, and most of the country has no functioning justice system. Military courts prosecute some conflict-related crimes but convictions are rare and sentences lenient. Corruption is endemic—the DRC ranks among the world's most corrupt. Police and soldiers extort civilians at checkpoints, officials embezzle mining revenues, and the elite loot state resources with total impunity. Prisons are medieval—severe overcrowding, starvation, disease, and deaths from neglect. Pretrial detention can last years. The International Criminal Court convicted Congolese warlords like Thomas Lubanga and Bosco Ntaganda, showing international justice can reach some perpetrators, but domestic accountability is nonexistent. The DRC's justice system is a façade.` },
  { name: 'Denmark', lat: 56.2639, lng: 9.5018, summary: `Denmark's criminal justice system ranks among the world's best, with strong rule of law, judicial independence, low corruption, and humane treatment of offenders. Crime rates are low—homicide around 1 per 100,000. Gang violence, primarily involving immigrant communities in Copenhagen and Aarhus, has increased, with shootings and grenade attacks linked to drug trafficking rivalries. Police are professional and trusted, though recent cases of racial profiling in immigrant neighborhoods have raised concerns. Corruption is minimal—Denmark consistently ranks among the least corrupt nations globally. The judiciary is independent and efficient, though some delays exist. Denmark's prisons emphasize rehabilitation over punishment, with open prisons, education programs, and humane conditions—a model studied worldwide. Recidivism rates are low compared to more punitive systems. Challenges include addressing gang violence without compromising civil liberties, ensuring equal treatment for immigrants and refugees, and maintaining public confidence amid isolated high-profile crimes. Overall, Denmark exemplifies how a justice system can be both effective and humane.` },
  { name: 'Djibouti', lat: 11.8251, lng: 42.5903, summary: `Djibouti's criminal justice system operates under authoritarian rule where President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh has held power since 1999. The judiciary lacks independence—courts serve government interests, particularly in political cases. Crime rates appear moderate, though reliable data is unavailable. Djibouti's strategic location hosting French, U.S., Chinese, and other foreign military bases creates security priorities around port facilities and base perimeters. Human trafficking and migrant smuggling occur as people transit through Djibouti toward Yemen and the Gulf. Corruption is significant—officials extort bribes, contracts favor connected elites, and port revenues are managed opaquely. Opposition figures face arrest on fabricated charges, and trials lack due process. Prisons are harsh, with overcrowding and poor conditions. Torture in detention occurs. The state prioritizes regime security and controlling dissent over delivering justice to ordinary citizens. Djibouti's strategic importance to foreign powers enables authoritarian governance without consequences, as Western allies overlook human rights abuses in exchange for base access.` },
  { name: 'Dominican Republic', lat: 18.7357, lng: -70.1627, summary: `The Dominican Republic's criminal justice system struggles with high crime, corruption, and delays. The homicide rate is approximately 10-12 per 100,000, driven by drug trafficking, gang violence, and domestic crime. Santo Domingo experiences armed robberies, carjackings, and shootings. The DR serves as a transit point for cocaine from South America to the U.S. and Europe, with trafficking organizations operating with partial impunity due to police corruption. Corruption pervades law enforcement and judiciary—police accept bribes, cases are fixed, and officials protect criminal networks. The anti-narcotics agency (DNCD) has made high-profile busts but faces accusations of corruption. Court backlogs delay justice for years—pretrial detention is excessive. The judiciary is nominally independent but faces political pressure. High-profile corruption cases occasionally reach conviction but elite impunity persists. Prisons are severely overcrowded and violent—the 2022 riot at La Victoria prison left 13 dead. Conditions are harsh, and gangs control internal operations. Police brutality and extrajudicial killings occur, particularly in poor neighborhoods. The system functions poorly, delivering neither security nor justice effectively for most Dominicans.` },
  { name: 'East Timor', lat: -8.8742, lng: 125.7275, summary: `East Timor's (Timor-Leste) criminal justice system is young, established after independence in 2002, and faces capacity limitations. Crime includes gang violence (particularly martial arts groups engaged in street fights and extortion), domestic violence, and property crime. The homicide rate is moderate. Corruption exists but is less systematic than in many developing nations. The judiciary struggles with case backlogs, insufficient judges, and limited legal expertise. Many judges and prosecutors received training through UN programs but capacity remains weak. Traditional justice mechanisms (customary law) operate alongside formal courts, sometimes conflicting. Police (PNTL) are lightly armed and often overwhelmed. UN peacekeepers departed in 2012, leaving security to national forces who lack resources and training. Prisons are overcrowded and conditions basic. The Special Tribunal for Serious Crimes prosecuted some Indonesian military and militia members for 1999 atrocities, but most perpetrators were never held accountable. Timor-Leste's justice system is building from scratch with limited resources, international support, and the challenge of creating modern institutions in a traditional society.` },
  { name: 'Ecuador', lat: -1.8312, lng: -78.1834, summary: `Ecuador's criminal justice system faces a crime explosion driven by drug trafficking organizations transforming the country into a cocaine transshipment hub and battleground. The homicide rate has skyrocketed to over 25 per 100,000—among Latin America's highest increases. Guayaquil and Esmeraldas experience extreme violence as Mexican cartels (Sinaloa, Jalisco Nueva Generación) and Colombian groups fight for port control. Prison massacres have killed hundreds—a 2021 riot left 119 dead as gangs clashed with grenades and guns inside. Ecuador's prisons are narco-controlled territories; authorities have lost control. Corruption has deeply infiltrated police, military, prosecutors, and politicians—trafficking groups buy protection and intelligence. Assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio in August 2023 during his campaign shocked the nation, illustrating traffickers' reach. President Daniel Noboa declared internal armed conflict and deployed military against gangs in 2024. The judiciary struggles with overwhelming caseloads, witness intimidation, and corruption. Ecuador's trajectory mirrors Colombia's 1980s-90s descent into narco-violence. The justice system is overwhelmed and losing.` },
  { name: 'Egypt', lat: 26.8206, lng: 30.8025, summary: `Egypt's criminal justice system operates under authoritarian military rule where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seized power in a 2013 coup. The judiciary lacks independence—courts serve regime interests, mass trials sentence hundreds simultaneously without due process, and death sentences are routine for political opponents. Terrorism from ISIS-affiliated groups in Sinai justifies security crackdowns, but the state uses counterterrorism laws to crush all dissent. Activists, journalists, bloggers, and protesters face arrest on charges like "spreading false news," "joining terrorist groups," or "misusing social media." Alaa Abd El-Fattah, prominent activist, has spent most of the last decade in prison. Tens of thousands of political prisoners fill Egypt's jails. Torture in detention is systematic—detainees report beatings, electric shocks, and sexual abuse. Forced disappearances occur; people vanish into State Security facilities without charge or family notification. Corruption is endemic despite official anti-corruption rhetoric. Military-linked businesses dominate the economy, and officials enrich themselves with impunity. Prisons are severely overcrowded and brutal—Tora, Scorpion, and other facilities hold political prisoners in isolation. Egypt's criminal justice system is a tool of authoritarian repression, not justice.` },
  { name: 'El Salvador', lat: 13.7942, lng: -88.8965, summary: `El Salvador's criminal justice system underwent radical transformation under President Nayib Bukele's "war on gangs." The homicide rate dropped from 50+ per 100,000 to around 2-3—among the world's steepest declines—as Bukele implemented a state of emergency in March 2022, suspending constitutional rights and arresting over 75,000 suspected gang members (roughly 1% of the population). Mega-prisons now hold MS-13 and Barrio 18 members in harsh conditions designed to break gang structures. Critics warn of mass human rights violations—arbitrary detentions, torture, innocent people arrested based on appearance or neighborhood, and suspension of due process. Trials are cursory; defendants lack legal representation. International human rights organizations condemn the approach, but Bukele enjoys massive popularity as Salvadorans, exhausted by decades of gang terror, accept authoritarian methods for security. The judiciary has been captured—Bukele's allies control the Supreme Court and Attorney General's office after 2021 constitutional crisis. Corruption investigations target opposition while government allies enjoy impunity. El Salvador's model trades rule of law for order, raising questions about sustainability and human costs.` },
  { name: 'Equatorial Guinea', lat: 1.6508, lng: 10.2679, summary: `Equatorial Guinea's criminal justice system operates as a tool of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo's kleptocratic dictatorship—Africa's longest-ruling leader seized power in a 1979 coup. The judiciary is completely controlled—trials of opponents are predetermined, courts legitimize regime actions, and justice is unavailable except to serve state interests. Crime data is nonexistent; the regime doesn't publish statistics. The real crime is endemic corruption—oil wealth enriches the ruling family and elite while most citizens live in poverty. Obiang's son, Teodoro "Teodorin" Nguema Obiang, exemplifies this: despite a nominal government salary, he owns luxury cars, mansions, and yachts worldwide, purchased with embezzled state funds. French courts convicted him of money laundering; U.S. authorities seized assets—yet he remains Vice President with impunity at home. Opposition figures face arbitrary arrest, torture, and imprisonment. The 2017 trial of over 100 opposition members on coup-plotting charges was a show trial resulting in lengthy sentences. Prisons are brutal—torture, starvation, and deaths occur. Equatorial Guinea's justice system is a façade for one of Africa's most repressive and corrupt regimes, where oil wealth finances tyranny.` },
  { name: 'Eritrea', lat: 15.1794, lng: 39.7823, summary: `Eritrea's criminal justice system doesn't exist in any meaningful sense—President Isaias Afwerki rules through absolute dictatorship with no constitution (despite one being drafted in 1997), no elections (none since independence in 1993), and no rule of law. The judiciary is completely controlled; "trials" are rare, and most detentions are indefinite without charge. Tens of thousands of political prisoners, journalists, religious minorities, and draft evaders fill secret detention centers and military camps. The government arrested the entire independent press in 2001; journalists remain imprisoned or have died in custody over two decades later. Religious persecution is systematic—Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostals, and other non-approved groups face arrest, torture, and forced labor. Military conscription is indefinite (officially 18 months, in practice years or indefinitely), amounting to forced labor. Deserters are imprisoned; their families punished. Torture is routine; underground prisons and shipping containers in the desert hold prisoners in brutal conditions. Corruption is controlled by the state—officials embezzle and extort, but all serve Afwerki's interests. Eritrea has no crime statistics, no independent judiciary, no legal protections—only totalitarian control making it one of the world's most repressive states, driving mass emigration.` },
  { name: 'Estonia', lat: 58.5953, lng: 25.0136, summary: `Estonia's criminal justice system represents post-Soviet success—a functional European democracy with strong rule of law, digital governance innovation, low corruption, and independent judiciary. Crime rates are low—homicide around 2 per 100,000. Organized crime includes drug trafficking (especially synthetic drugs and cannabis), human trafficking, and money laundering. Estonia's position on Russia's border creates smuggling concerns. Cybersecurity is a priority given the 2007 Russian cyberattacks. Corruption is low by regional standards—Transparency International ranks Estonia among the least corrupt post-Soviet states. However, procurement irregularities and political financing scandals occur. The judiciary is independent, efficient, and increasingly digital—Estonia pioneered e-justice systems allowing online case management. Police are professional, though occasional brutality cases emerge, particularly involving ethnic Russian minority. Prisons meet European standards with emphasis on rehabilitation. Estonia's Russian-speaking minority (about 25% of population) faces some discrimination in justice system interactions, though disparities are less severe than in Latvia. The system works well overall, balancing security, rights protection, and technological innovation—a model for transitioning post-Soviet states.` },
  { name: 'Ethiopia', lat: 9.1450, lng: 40.4897, summary: `Ethiopia's criminal justice system collapsed during the 2020-2022 Tigray War and ongoing ethnic conflicts. The Tigray conflict saw mass atrocities—massacres, sexual violence as a weapon of war, starvation as a tactic—committed by Ethiopian federal forces, Eritrean troops, and Tigrayan forces. International investigators documented war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, yet accountability is nonexistent. The government blocked investigations, denied access, and imprisoned journalists exposing abuses. Ethnic violence in Oromia, Amhara, and other regions continues, with security forces and ethnic militias committing killings, arbitrary detention, and torture. The judiciary lacks independence—courts serve the ruling Prosperity Party's interests under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for ending the Eritrea conflict, then launched the Tigray War. Political opponents, journalists (including prominent journalist Eskinder Nega), and activists face arrest on terrorism charges. Prisons are severely overcrowded and harsh. Corruption is endemic—Ethiopia ranks poorly on Transparency International indices. The justice system doesn't deliver justice; it serves ethnic power politics and authoritarian control. Reconciliation and accountability remain distant.` },
  { name: 'Falkland Islands', lat: -51.7963, lng: -59.5236, summary: `The Falkland Islands' criminal justice system operates as a British Overseas Territory with English common law. Crime is minimal—violent crime is virtually nonexistent in this remote archipelago of 3,500 residents. The judiciary consists of local magistrates and visiting judges from the UK for serious cases. Police (Royal Falkland Islands Police) are small and professional. Prisons barely exist—serious criminals are transferred to the UK. The main "justice" issues are fishing violations and occasional alcohol-related offenses. The Falklands' legal status is disputed by Argentina, but the islands operate British legal institutions with no Argentine jurisdiction. The system functions smoothly for the small, stable population.` },
  { name: 'Fiji', lat: -17.7134, lng: 178.0650, summary: `Fiji's criminal justice system operates in a democracy restored after decades of coups and military rule. Crime includes violent offenses (homicide around 2-3 per 100,000), drug trafficking (Fiji is a transshipment point for drugs to Australia and New Zealand), and property crime. Corruption exists, particularly in police and lower courts—Transparency International ranks Fiji moderately corrupt. The judiciary regained independence after the 2014 constitution, but scars from military interference remain. Police face accusations of brutality and failure to investigate crimes against marginalized communities, including indigenous iTaukei and Indo-Fijian populations. Prisons are overcrowded and conditions harsh. Ethnic tensions between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians (descendants of Indian laborers) affect justice outcomes, with perceptions of bias. The system functions better than during military rule but requires addressing police abuse, corruption, and ethnic disparities to consolidate rule of law.` },
  { name: 'Finland', lat: 61.9241, lng: 25.7482, summary: `Finland's criminal justice system exemplifies Nordic excellence—low crime, minimal corruption, independent judiciary, humane prisons emphasizing rehabilitation, and high public trust. The homicide rate is approximately 1.4 per 100,000. Violent crime is rare outside of domestic violence and alcohol-related incidents. Organized crime includes drug trafficking, motorcycle gang activity, and links to Estonian and Russian criminal networks. Corruption is nearly nonexistent—Finland ranks among the world's least corrupt nations. The judiciary is independent, professional, and efficient. Police are highly trained and trusted. Finland's prisons are considered the world's most humane—open prisons, education programs, low recidivism. However, immigration from Middle East and Africa has increased crime in some areas, fueling political debates. The far-right Finns Party exploits crime fears, though actual rates remain low. The system's challenge is maintaining liberal values amid demographic change and populist pressures. Overall, Finland shows how a justice system can be both effective and humane.` },
  { name: 'France', lat: 46.2276, lng: 2.2137, summary: `France's criminal justice system operates as a developed democracy but faces serious challenges—terrorism, organized crime, police brutality, and criminal justice reform debates. Crime rates are moderate—homicide around 1.3 per 100,000. Terrorism from Islamist extremists has struck repeatedly (Charlie Hebdo, Bataclan, Nice truck attack), leading to aggressive counterterrorism laws that critics say erode civil liberties. Organized crime includes drug trafficking in Marseille (where gang violence rivals any European city), Corsican mafia, and West African networks. Corruption is relatively low but exists—recent scandals involving police, judges, and politicians demonstrate the problem. The judiciary is independent but overburdened—courts face massive backlogs. Police (National Police and Gendarmerie) are professional but face accusations of brutality, particularly against minorities in banlieues (suburbs). The "yellow vest" protests saw police using tear gas and rubber bullets aggressively. Prisons are severely overcrowded—France holds over 70,000 in spaces for 60,000. Conditions violate European standards; radicalization in prisons is a concern. France's justice system works but is strained by terrorism threats, social tensions, and resource constraints.` },
  { name: 'French Southern and Antarctic Lands', lat: -49.2804, lng: 69.3486, summary: `French Southern and Antarctic Lands have minimal permanent population (scientific staff and military) and operate under French law administered from Réunion. Crime is effectively nonexistent. Legal jurisdiction is French, with visiting magistrates handling any issues. The "justice system" is theoretical given the lack of criminal activity in these remote territories.` },
  { name: 'Gabon', lat: -0.8037, lng: 11.6094, summary: `Gabon's criminal justice system operates under military rule following the August 2023 coup that overthrew the Bongo family dynasty after 55 years in power. Oligui Nguema now leads a transitional government. Crime rates are moderate—violent crime exists but statistics are unreliable. Gabon's wealth from oil has concentrated in the elite, with corruption endemic under the Bongos. Ali Bongo and family members embezzled billions, purchasing luxury properties worldwide. French authorities investigated and seized assets, but domestic accountability was nonexistent while the family ruled. The coup leaders promised anti-corruption reforms and are investigating Bongo-era officials, though selective justice concerns arise. The judiciary was completely controlled by the Bongos; its independence under military rule is questionable. Prisons are overcrowded and harsh. Police are poorly trained and corrupt. Whether Gabon's transitional justice efforts lead to genuine reform or merely replace one authoritarian system with another remains to be seen.` },
  { name: 'Gambia', lat: 13.4432, lng: -15.3101, summary: `Gambia's criminal justice system is recovering from Yahya Jammeh's 22-year dictatorship (1994-2017), which was characterized by extrajudicial killings, torture, forced disappearances, and total judicial subservience. The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), established after Jammeh fled into exile in 2017, documented horrific abuses—death squads, witch hunts, sexual violence by Jammeh himself. Recommendations for prosecutions have been made, but President Adama Barrow's government has been slow to implement accountability, partly fearing political instability. The judiciary is being reformed to restore independence, but capacity is weak. Corruption remains significant—police demand bribes, officials embezzle, and procurement is rigged. Crime includes drug trafficking (Gambia is a transit point for Latin American cocaine to Europe) and human trafficking. Prisons are overcrowded and conditions harsh, though improving from Jammeh-era torture centers. Gambia faces the challenge of transitioning from dictatorship to rule of law with limited resources, weak institutions, and a former president living unpunished in Equatorial Guinea. The system is improving but fragile.` },
  { name: 'Georgia', lat: 42.3154, lng: 43.3569, summary: `Georgia's criminal justice system has undergone substantial reforms since the Rose Revolution (2003) and subsequent governments, though backsliding and political interference persist. Crime rates declined dramatically—homicide around 2 per 100,000. Police reform transformed the notoriously corrupt traffic police into a professional force, improving public trust. However, politicized prosecutions remain a problem. Former President Mikheil Saakashvili was imprisoned after returning from exile, in what he and supporters call political persecution for opposing the ruling Georgian Dream party. The judiciary faces accusations of political influence, particularly in cases involving opposition figures. Organized crime includes drug trafficking from Afghanistan through Central Asia to Europe. Corruption has increased under Georgian Dream after earlier reforms—Transparency International notes deterioration. Prisons improved significantly from Soviet-era brutality, though a 2012 torture scandal exposed ongoing abuses. The system's trajectory depends on whether Georgia continues Euro-Atlantic integration (requiring rule of law standards) or slides toward authoritarianism under pressure from Russia. Currently, it's contested territory between reform and regression.` },
  { name: 'Germany', lat: 51.1657, lng: 10.4515, summary: `Germany's criminal justice system ranks among the world's strongest, with independent judiciary, low corruption, professional law enforcement, and humane prisons emphasizing rehabilitation. Crime rates are low—homicide around 0.9 per 100,000. Challenges include organized crime (Italian mafias, Russian networks, Middle Eastern clans particularly in Berlin), far-right terrorism (2020 Hanau shootings, NSU murders), and Islamist extremism (2016 Berlin Christmas market attack). Corruption is low—Germany ranks highly on Transparency International—but scandals involving politicians and corporate fraud occur (Wirecard scandal, Volkswagen emissions fraud). The judiciary is independent and efficient, though massive refugee influx since 2015 strained capacity. Police are professional but faced criticism for failing to prevent terror attacks due to intelligence gaps. Far-right infiltration of police and military raised concerns. Prisons are humane with focus on reintegration. Germany's challenge is balancing security against terrorism and organized crime while maintaining civil liberties and addressing far-right radicalization within security institutions. The system functions well but isn't complacent.` }

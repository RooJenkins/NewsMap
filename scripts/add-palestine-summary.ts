const summary = `The ceasefire that was supposed to end the horror collapsed in less than two months. Gaza's fragile truce, brokered in January 2025 and implemented on October 10, lasted just 59 days before shattering on March 18. Now, as of November 2025, the death toll has reached almost 70,000 Palestinians killed and 170,679 injured since October 7, 2023. The Gaza Ministry of Health updates these numbers daily, and they keep climbing. UNRWA—the UN agency that's kept millions of Palestinians alive for decades—has lost 381 of its own staff members, the highest death toll of any UN mission in history. But the crisis in November 2025 isn't just about the body count in Gaza. Israel has effectively banned UNRWA from operating in its territory, including the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, creating a humanitarian catastrophe just as winter approaches. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, Operation Iron Wall—launched in January—has displaced 32,000 Palestinian refugees from Tulkarm Camp alone, the largest displacement since 1967. And hovering over everything is an economic collapse so severe that unemployment has hit 80%, GDP has cratered, and famine has been officially declared in parts of Gaza. This is a society being systematically destroyed, and the international community is watching it happen in real time.

**The Big Issue 1: The UNRWA Ban and the Winter Crisis**

On January 30, 2025, Israeli legislation banning UNRWA operations came into effect, and the consequences have been catastrophic. The laws passed by the Knesset in October 2024 require UNRWA to cease all activities in Israeli territory—which Israel defines as including the occupied West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Schools shut down. Healthcare centers closed. The entire infrastructure that kept 2.3 million Gazans and hundreds of thousands of West Bank Palestinians alive simply stopped functioning. UN officials warned from the start that this ban would undermine the fragile ceasefire and sabotage Gaza's recovery. They were right. By November 5, the Shelter Cluster—a coalition of humanitarian organizations—issued a stark warning: at least 259,000 Palestinian families, more than 1.45 million people, will face winter without adequate protection because Israeli authorities continue to block lifesaving shelter supplies from entering Gaza. The list of rejected items reads like a dark joke: vehicles, solar panels, x-ray machines, generators, education supplies, even fresh meat. These aren't weapons—they're the bare necessities of survival. Yet Israel's restrictions remain in place, justified under security concerns that humanitarian workers call absurd. Norway stepped up in late January with a $24 million contribution to UNRWA, with Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide declaring, "Gaza is in ruins, and UNRWA's help is more necessary than ever." But Norway can't replace what's been lost. Over 38,000 children are receiving education in 251 temporary learning spaces set up in UNRWA schools-turned-shelters, a fraction of what's needed. Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's Commissioner-General, warned the Security Council that the ban "jeopardizes the lives of millions of Palestinians and risks undermining the fragile ceasefire." As November rolls on and temperatures drop, the question isn't whether people will die from cold, disease, and starvation—it's how many.

**The Big Issue 2: Operation Iron Wall and the Forgotten West Bank**

While the world's attention fixates on Gaza, the West Bank is experiencing its own quiet catastrophe. On January 21, Israel launched Operation Iron Wall, the largest military operation in the occupied territories since the Second Intifada. Tulkarm Camp, home to a dense population of Palestinian refugees, has borne the brunt of the assault. By November 2025, Israeli forces had renewed the military order against the camp until January 31, 2026, and 32,000 Palestine refugees remain forcibly displaced—the biggest displacement event in the West Bank since the Six-Day War in 1967. The death toll in the West Bank tells its own story: between October 7, 2023, and November 3, 2025, 1,012 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 215 children. These aren't combat deaths in a war zone—these are killings during raids, at checkpoints, in the streets of towns and refugee camps. The operation's stated goal is to root out armed resistance groups, but the reality on the ground looks more like collective punishment. Homes are demolished, infrastructure destroyed, entire neighborhoods turned into rubble. Israeli officials justify Iron Wall as necessary counter-terrorism, pointing to attacks originating from the West Bank. Palestinian leaders and human rights organizations call it ethnic cleansing by another name. What's clear is that the West Bank—already suffering under decades of occupation—is now experiencing a level of military violence not seen in years. The displacement of 32,000 people isn't an accident or collateral damage; it's the point. And unlike Gaza, where the world at least pretends to care, the West Bank crisis is unfolding in near-total international silence.

**The Big Issue 3: Economic Collapse and the Famine Declaration**

The numbers are almost incomprehensible. Unemployment across the Palestinian territories has surged to over 80%. GDP has "dramatically shrunk," in the careful language of World Bank reports—the West Bank contracted by 23% in the first half of 2024, while Gaza suffered an 86% collapse. For 2024, the World Bank estimates a real GDP decline of 26% for the entire Palestinian economy. But the sterile language of economic reports can't capture what this means on the ground. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report, 91% of Gaza's population—over 2 million people—is facing acute food insecurity. Of those, 875,000 individuals are at emergency levels, and 345,000 are at catastrophic levels, the highest classification before famine is officially declared. In northern Gaza, that threshold has already been crossed. The famine isn't a natural disaster—it's engineered. Israel controls what enters Gaza, and the restrictions on food, water, and medical supplies are deliberate. Reports from humanitarian organizations describe aid trucks waiting for days or weeks at border crossings, their contents inspected item by item and often rejected for opaque "security" reasons. The banking system is collapsing too. Israel has threatened not to renew the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws that allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks—a renewal that's due in November 2025. If that waiver expires, Palestinians will be cut off from the global financial system entirely, unable to receive salaries, transfer money, or conduct basic commerce. UN experts issued a statement in September calling Israel's "financial stranglehold" on the occupied Palestinian territory a form of economic warfare that must end. It hasn't. Reconstruction of Gaza, already estimated to require tens of billions of dollars and decades of work, hasn't even begun. Without international funding and political will, it likely never will.

**The International Angle**

The international response to the Palestinian crisis has been a masterclass in performative concern and actual inaction. The UN Security Council has been briefed repeatedly on the UNRWA ban, the humanitarian catastrophe, and the ceasefire violations. Each time, diplomats express "deep concern" and call for "all parties to exercise restraint." Nothing changes. The UN Palestinian Rights Committee Bureau issued a strong statement condemning Israel's UNRWA ban and appealing to the General Assembly, the Security Council, and all member states to "categorically reject Israel's unlawful legislation." The appeal was ignored. In September, UN experts warned that Israel's financial stranglehold must end. The stranglehold continues. The U.S., Palestine's most important potential advocate, remains paralyzed by domestic politics and its unwavering support for Israel. European nations issue statements, provide humanitarian aid, and do little else. Arab states, once vocal champions of the Palestinian cause, are increasingly focused on normalizing relations with Israel for economic and strategic reasons. The Abraham Accords continue to expand, with Saudi Arabia still considering joining despite the ongoing crisis. For Palestinians, the message is clear: you are on your own. The ceasefire's collapse in March was met with muted international reaction. The UNRWA ban, a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law according to most legal experts, has faced no meaningful consequences. Operation Iron Wall and the displacement of 32,000 refugees barely made headlines. The harsh truth is that the world has decided the Palestinian crisis is intractable, and the political will to seriously pressure Israel—or even to adequately fund humanitarian relief—simply doesn't exist. Regional dynamics add another layer. Jordan, hosting millions of Palestinian refugees, faces its own stability concerns if the crisis worsens. Egypt, controlling Gaza's southern border, has kept the Rafah crossing largely closed, fearing that opening it would make it complicit in Palestinian displacement. Lebanon, drowning in its own economic and political collapse, can offer nothing. Even fellow Palestinians are divided: the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remain locked in their own bitter rivalry, unable to present a unified front.

**The Bottom Line**

November 2025 finds Palestine not at a crossroads but in freefall. The ceasefire is dead, UNRWA is crippled, the West Bank is under assault, and the economy has collapsed into famine and mass unemployment. Nearly 70,000 Palestinians are dead, hundreds of thousands are injured, and millions face winter without shelter, food, or medical care. The international community has proven itself utterly unable or unwilling to intervene meaningfully. What comes next? More of the same, most likely. Israeli officials show no sign of lifting the UNRWA ban or easing restrictions on Gaza. Operation Iron Wall in the West Bank has been extended through January 2026 and could easily continue beyond that. The economic stranglehold will tighten if the banking waiver expires in November. Famine will spread. The death toll will climb. Watch for the banking waiver decision—if it expires, the humanitarian crisis will accelerate dramatically. Watch for whether any international actor finds the political courage to impose real costs on Israel for its actions. Watch for signs of renewed violence as desperate populations in both Gaza and the West Bank run out of options. This is a slow-motion catastrophe, and barring a dramatic shift in international will, the only question is how much worse it gets before the world finally decides it's gone too far.`

## Next Steps:
The infrastructure-writeups-all.ts script is functional and has successfully saved 24 countries to the database. To complete all 114 countries, additional writeups need to be added following the same format and Robert Caro voice characteristics.

Each writeup follows the structure:
- Opening: Power dynamics, follow the money
- 3 Big Issues: Obsessive detail, who benefits/pays
- International Angle: Geopolitical implications
- Bottom Line: Long-term consequences

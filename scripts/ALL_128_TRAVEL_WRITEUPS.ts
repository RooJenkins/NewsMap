    summary: `Don't come to Afghanistan. Not now. The Tourism Ministry—abolished by the Taliban in 2021 because "tourism is un-Islamic"—used to count 20,000 annual visitors. November 2025: that's near zero. U.S. State Department: "Do not travel." Taliban control everything, ISIS-K attacks throughout 2024-25 killing civilians and targeting foreigners. What you're missing: Bamiyan Valley where 6th-century Buddha statues stood before Taliban destroyed them in 2001, haunting against Hindu Kush peaks. Herat's Friday Mosque with intricate blue tilework, the 65-meter minaret of Jam (UNESCO site in the middle of nowhere), Wakhan Corridor where snow leopards roam Pamir peaks. Could be a trekking paradise—Band-e-Amir's six turquoise lakes, Panjshir Valley's orchards and mountains. But Taliban banned women from working (no female guides or guesthouses), enforce medieval dress, forbid music. Economy collapsed—22.9 million need aid, hotels shuttered, tourism dead. Only foreigners: UN staff, NGO workers, reckless YouTubers. Infrastructure non-existent. Kabul: Serena Hotel (survived 2022 attack) under checkpoints; guesthouses lack electricity/water/Wi-Fi. Flights unreliable (Kam Air, Ariana—old Soviet jets). Roads have IEDs, Taliban checkpoints demanding bribes, bandits. No tourism board, visitor centers, English signs. Spring/autumn best weather but academic in war zone. Visa: no tourist visas, only business/journalist requiring Afghan sponsor (weeks, $200+ bribes). Kabul airport: Taliban officers demanding unexplained payments. Women alone: impossible. LGBT: death penalty. Safety: extreme kidnapping risk ($100K+ ransoms), ISIS-K attacks on hotels, arbitrary Taliban detentions. Tourism: 0% GDP. Taliban runs on opium, smuggling, aid. Hidden gems inaccessible: Wakhan (no permits), Panjshir (military zone), Balkh (ISIS-K). **Bottom line:** Closed under Taliban. Extraordinary beauty locked behind regime viewing outsiders as threats, women as property. Stay home unless you're a war correspondent. Maybe someday, not this decade.`,

    name: 'Albania',
    lat: 41.3275,
    lng: 19.8187,
    summary: `Albania's having a moment. 10.2M visitors 2024 (up from 7.5M 2023), €4.1B tourism revenue, Albanian Riviera Instagram-famous as "last affordable Med paradise." November 2025: Tirana's Blloku buzzing with Italians, Ksamil packed, UNESCO threatening to de-list Butrint over overtourism damage. PM Rama bet on tourism—visa-free for 120+ countries (US/EU/China 90 days), coastal infrastructure, marketing as "Greece without crowds/prices." Working. Too well. Riviera (Saranda/Himara/Dhermi/Ksamil): turquoise Ionian, white sand, cliffside villages, fresh fish €15. Fraction of Greece/Croatia: hotel €50, meal €15, car €150/week. But dark side: illegal concrete hotels, plastic beaches, sewage, prices spiking, locals priced out. Can Albania scale sustainably or repeat Spain/Greece mistakes? Infrastructure improving, uneven. Tirana vibrant: Skanderbeg Square, painted buildings, Bunk'Art (Cold War bunker museums), nightlife rivals Belgrade. Hotels €30-200, qofte/byrek to fusion, Bolt/buses easy. Riviera: Saranda overdeveloped but convenient (Corfu ferry); Himara/Dhermi laid-back; Ksamil "Albania's Maldives" but mobbed summer. Inland: Berat/Gjirokastër UNESCO Ottoman towns; Albanian Alps (Theth/Valbona) hikers' paradise, Dolomites-level peaks. Transport: furgons cheap/slow; car better (hairpins, potholes); no rail. English wide in tourist zones. Food underrated: meats, fish, fërgesë, raki, good wine. Safety good—low violent crime (2.3/100K, below US). Petty theft Tirana/resorts. Scams: taxi/restaurant fees, hotel photo mismatches. Mafia controls construction/smuggling, not tourists. Driving chaotic (8.3 road deaths/100K, Europe worst). Beaches: no lifeguards, rip currents. LGBT: Tirana tolerant, rural not. Women: catcalling, staring, safe. Visa minimal: 120+ countries visa-free 90 days. E-visas Pakistan/India/Egypt ($35, week). Fly Tirana (TIA)—Wizz/Ryanair 50+ European cities (London €30 round-trip). Overland Greece/Montenegro/Kosovo/Macedonia easy. Best May-Jun/Sep-Oct (warm, fewer crowds, low prices). Jul-Aug peak (mobbed, prices double, 35°C). Winter dead (hotels closed, mountain roads impassable, gray Tirana). Alps Jun-Sep hiking; skiing emerging, underdeveloped. Tourism 21% GDP, 300K jobs (1 in 4), €4.1B annual. Target 12M/€6B 2027, EU membership. Reckoning coming: Riviera destroyed overdevelopment, mafia construction, environmental neglect. UNESCO Butrint warning is canary. Himara locals: land tripled, rents unaffordable. Hidden gems vanishing: Gjipe Beach (boat-only) now bars/ATVs; Theth 50+ guesthouses, overrun summer. Next: north (Shkodra, Lake Koman, Accursed Mountains), cultural tourism. **Bottom line:** Europe's best value now—beaches, mountains, history, 1990s prices. Go soon: secret's out, crowds coming, development wrecking Riviera. Unspoiled? Alps/north. Beaches? Ksamil = new Mykonos (minus price, for now). Racing EU 2030, tourism's ticket—selling soul.`,

    name: 'Algeria',
    lat: 36.7538,
    lng: 3.0588,
    summary: `Algeria wants tourists, can't commit. November 2025 "Algeria 2025" campaign: Saharan dunes, Roman Timgad, Med beaches, UNESCO sites. Target 3M visitors 2030 (currently ~200K, mostly diaspora/business). Reality: Byzantine visa (months wait, hotel confirmations, invitation letters), crumbling Soviet hotels, terrible roads, no English signs, Ministry reorganized three times since 2020, no strategy. But the pitch: North Africa's most spectacular under-visited landscapes. Tassili n'Ajjer (SE Sahara): 15,000-year rock art—prehistoric giraffes/elephants/hunters on sandstone plateaus. M'zab Valley (Ghardaïa): UNESCO 10th-century Berber fortified city, still inhabited, pristine. Roman Timgad/Djémila rival Tunisia/Libya, 1% the visitors. Kabylie mountains: Berber villages, cedars, hiking Europeans would kill for. Med coast: 2,000km beaches/coves/Ottoman ports, empty vs Tunisia/Morocco. But hard. Visa: most need it (Americans/Europeans/Canadians pre-approval Algiers), $100+, 4-8 weeks, unexplained rejections. Overland Tunisia/Morocco possible, slow—borders close arbitrarily, hostile guards. Flights Algiers (Air Algérie monopoly, expensive, poor service). Infrastructure Soviet-grade: state hotels 1970s (sporadic hot water, no Wi-Fi), private rare/overpriced, barely any Airbnb. Transport: unreliable domestic flights, slow trains (Algiers-Oran 6h/400km), crowded buses, car rental = corrupt checkpoints. English rare—French default, Arabic/Berber. Ministry talks "development," corruption/bureaucracy stalls. Small tour operators, unlicensed guides (quality varies), no central booking. Safety mixed. Algiers/coast safe—low violent crime, minimal harassment (women: persistent catcalling). Sahara: bandits, smuggling, jihad ist remnants (AQIM splinters). Government restricts southern regions (Tamanrasset/Djanet permits), foreigners need registered guides ($150-300/day). Roadblocks ubiquitous (police/military every 50km, passport checks). Photography absurd: no government buildings/military/police/"strategic infrastructure" (bridges/ports/random buildings). Tourists detained for innocent photos. Best Oct-Apr (Sahara scorching May-Sep, coast summers hot/tolerable). Ramadan (Mar-Apr 2026) complicates (closed daytime restaurants, reduced services). Numbers dismal: 200K 2024 (90% diaspora, 5% business, 5% tourists). Tourism <1% GDP—hydrocarbon economy (oil/gas 95% exports). "Algeria 2025" promises simplified visas, hotels, airports—all talk. November 2025 visa nightmare continues, Soviet hotels, Ministry fired another director. Potential extraordinary: Saharan adventure (better landscapes than Morocco, fewer tourists than Tunisia), cultural (Roman/Ottoman/Berber), beach (pristine Med). No political will. Tebboune prioritizes hydrocarbons, geopolitics (Morocco tensions Western Sahara, France colonial history), not tourism. Young Algerians leaving (harraga boat migrants Europe). Hidden gems everywhere, accessible to none. Hoggar Mountains (Tamanrasset): volcanic, Tuareg nomads, de Foucauld hermitage. Aurès Mountains: Berber villages, Roman ruins, gorges—no hotels/guides/infrastructure. Gouraya National Park (Béjaïa): coastal cliffs, Barbary macaques, beaches—3h potholed drive Algiers. Constantine "City of Bridges": Ottoman palaces, gorges, 19th-century suspension bridges—hard to reach. **Bottom line:** North Africa's most frustrating—immense beauty, negligible infrastructure, Byzantine bureaucracy. Hardcore adventurers with patience for visa hassles, checkpoints, crumbling hotels: Saharan landscapes/Roman ruins worth it. Want ease? Morocco/Tunisia. Government wants revenues, won't invest in reforms. Until then, for truly committed—or foolish.`,

    name: 'Angola',
    lat: -8.8383,
    lng: 13.2344,
    summary: `Angola wants to be Africa's next tourism frontier. Reality check: November 2025, it's nowhere close. Government's "Angola Tourism 2027" plan promises 1M annual visitors (currently 300K, mostly oil workers/Congolese traders), but visa requirements punitive (e-visas introduced 2024 but expensive/slow), infrastructure crumbling outside Luanda, safety concerns persist. The pitch: Angola has extraordinary landscapes nobody's seen. Kalandula Falls (105m, wider than Victoria), Serra da Leba mountain pass (dizzying switchbacks carved into red cliffs), Iona National Park (Africa's oldest, bordering Namib), Tundavala Gap (sheer escarpment, savanna views), Miradouro da Lua ("Moon Valley"—lunar landscapes outside Luanda), 1,600km Atlantic coastline (pristine beaches, zero tourists). Luanda improving—waterfront Marginal promenade renovated 2024, Fortress of São Miguel (17th-century Portuguese fort, now museum) restored, new hotels (Epic Sana, TRYP) offer international standards. But Luanda remains one of world's most expensive cities (oil boom legacy—hotel €200+/night, meal €30+, taxi €20 across town), traffic apocalyptic, poverty extreme (gleaming towers next to musseques slums). Outside Luanda, adventure travel territory. Benguela beaches (Baía Azul, Caotinha) stunning but lack facilities. Lobito's Restinga Peninsula Instagram-perfect (narrow sand spit, turquoise lagoon) but one decent hotel. Namibe Province (south): deserts, dunes, welwitschia plants (2,000 years old), but reaching them requires 4x4, camping gear, risk tolerance. Infrastructure challenges: domestic flights expensive/unreliable (TAAG Angola Airlines monopoly), roads outside Luanda potholed/mined (civil war legacy—landmines still risk in rural areas), trains limited (Benguela Railway recently reopened to Zambia, mostly freight). English rare; Portuguese essential. Visa: e-visa introduced November 2024 ($120, 7-10 days processing) but requires yellow fever vaccination, hotel booking, return flight, invitation letter for some nationalities. Easier than old system (embassy visits, months waiting) but not simple. Americans need visa; EU too. On-arrival only for Portuguese passport holders. Best May-October dry season (cooler, accessible roads); November-April rainy (flooding, impassable roads in provinces). Safety mixed: Luanda relatively safe (petty crime, avoid musseques at night), provinces require caution (banditry, landmines off main roads, police checkpoints demanding bribes). Cabinda enclave (north, separated from Angola by DR Congo strip) oil-rich but tense—separatist movement, heavy military, not advised for tourism. Tourism impact negligible—<1% GDP (oil 95% exports, 75% government revenue). The 300K annual "tourists" mostly business travelers (oil/mining), Congolese traders, diaspora Angolans. Actual leisure tourists: maybe 30,000. Government talks big—"Angola Tourism 2027" pledges visa simplification, hotel construction, national park development, marketing—but execution weak. Ministry of Tourism underfunded, corruption rampant, private sector wary of investing. Hidden gems everywhere: Kissama National Park (2h south Luanda, reintroduced elephants/giraffes after war), Baia dos Tigres (abandoned fishing village on desert peninsula, ghost town vibe), Quedas do Binga (Angola's tallest waterfall, remote Cuanza Sul), Black Rocks of Pungo Andongo (giant granite formations, sacred to Kimbundu people). But accessing them hard—poor roads, no tourism infrastructure, limited guides. **Bottom line:** Angola has Africa-level potential—falls, deserts, beaches, wildlife—but Africa-level problems: expensive visas, crumbling infrastructure, safety concerns, no tourism culture. Hardcore adventurer with budget and patience, landscapes reward. Want ease? Namibia/Botswana/South Africa next door with better infrastructure. Angola is oil state pretending to care about tourism. Maybe 2027 changes that. Maybe not.`,

    name: 'Argentina',
    lat: -38.4161,
    lng: -63.6167,
    summary: `Argentina November 2025: Javier Milei's libertarian "shock therapy" has collapsed the peso (now 1,500 to USD, unofficial rate higher), making this South American giant absurdly cheap for dollar/euro holders and financially desperate for locals. Tourism numbers: 7.4M arrivals 2024, projected 8M+ 2025 as foreigners exploit currency arbitrage. Buenos Aires, Patagonia, Mendoza wine country, Iguazu Falls—all suddenly accessible at 1990s prices while inflation crushes Argentines. It's uncomfortable and extraordinary. Buenos Aires: Europe in South America, tango in San Telmo, Recoleta Cemetery (Evita's tomb), Palermo Soho's hipster cafes, La Boca's colorful Caminito. Steak dinner with Malbec: $15 USD. Four-star hotel: $40/night. Locals earning pesos can't afford it; tourists live like kings on budgets. Milei cut subsidies, poverty spiked to 52%, but tourist dollars are welcomed desperately. Infrastructure excellent in Buenos Aires (subte metro, Uber, buses), patchy in provinces. Flights cheap (Aerolíneas Argentinas domestic routes $30-100), but service suffering from austerity cuts. Patagonia is why people fly 14 hours: Perito Moreno Glacier (massive ice wall calving into lake, El Calafate base), Torres del Paine (technically Chile but accessed via El Calafate), Ushuaia (world's southernmost city, gateway to Antarctica cruises, Beagle Channel), Bariloche (Swiss Alps aesthetics, chocolate shops, skiing Jul-Sep, trekking Dec-Mar). November-March is Patagonia season: long days, wildflowers, accessible trails. El Chaltén for Fitz Roy hikes. Península Valdés for whales (Jun-Dec), penguins, sea lions. Iguazu Falls (northeast, border with Brazil): 275 waterfalls, most impressive in rainy season (Nov-Mar but can be jungle-humid). Argentine side has best walkways/views; visit both sides if you have time. Mendoza: wine country at Andes' feet. Malbec vineyards, bike tours, asados (BBQ), Aconcagua (Western Hemisphere's tallest peak, serious climb). Salta/Jujuy (northwest): Quebrada de Humahuaca's rainbow mountains, colonial towns, high-altitude deserts, Cafayate wine region. Infrastructure: Salta charming but remote, roads rough. Safety: Buenos Aires has pickpocketing (subte, tourist areas), express kidnappings rare but exist. Provinces generally safe; Patagonia very safe. Milei's austerity cut police budgets, crime ticking up in cities. Political tension—protests common in Buenos Aires (Milei vs unions/leftists). Avoid protests (police use tear gas liberally). Visa: Americans/EU/Canadians/Australians no visa for 90 days, free entry (reciprocity fee abolished 2016). Entry simple: stamp passport, done. Best time: Nov-Mar for Patagonia/beaches; Apr-Oct for Mendoza wine harvest/skiing Bariloche; BA pleasant year-round (skip Jul-Aug if you hate cold). Peak season prices (Dec-Feb) still cheap by US/EU standards. Costs: November 2025 unofficial exchange rate makes everything dirt cheap. Hostel $8/night, mid-range hotel $40, steak dinner $15, wine bottle $5, domestic flight $50. Use Western Union or exchange cash on "cuevas" (unofficial exchanges) for best rates—credit cards get official rate (worse). ATMs limit withdrawals, high fees. Bring USD cash. Tourism: 7.8% GDP, 1.1M jobs, but Milei's austerity slashed tourism ministry budget. Promotion weak, but weak peso is best marketing. Overtourism nowhere—Patagonia can handle more; BA has capacity. Hidden gems: Esteros del Iberá wetlands (northeast, caiman/capybara/birds, rewilding project by Tompkins Conservation), Quebrada de las Conchas (Salta, red rock canyon), Tierra del Fuego National Park (Ushuaia, end-of-world trails). **Bottom line:** Argentina is stunningly beautiful and tragically cheap. You'll eat world-class food, see glaciers/waterfalls/mountains, dance tango, and drink Malbec for less than a weekend in Miami. But you're profiting off economic collapse that's gutting the middle class. Go, tip generously, spend money, and understand the privilege. For travelers, it's a golden moment. For Argentines, it's a nightmare.`,

    name: 'Armenia',
    lat: 40.0691,
    lng: 45.0382,
    summary: `Armenia in November 2025 is the Caucasus' surprise tourism success—2.1M visitors in 2024 (up from 1.5M pre-COVID), driven by diaspora returns, Russian digital nomads fleeing mobilization, and adventurous Europeans discovering it's Georgia without the crowds. This ancient Christian nation (first to adopt Christianity in 301 AD) offers monasteries carved into cliffs, Soviet brutalism, brandy tastings, and Mount Ararat views (technically in Turkey but Armenia's spiritual symbol). It's raw, affordable, and real. Yerevan, the capital, is pink—literally, most buildings use volcanic tuff. Republic Square at night with fountains, Cascade complex (Soviet-era stairway/modern art museum), Vernissage flea market (Soviet memorabilia, carpets, antiques), cafes everywhere. Food: khorovats (BBQ), lavash (flatbread), dolma, Armenian wine/brandy. Ararat Brandy Factory tour: Stalin's favorite. Hotels $30-150, meals $10-20, Uber-like services cheap. Infrastructure improved: new highways, 4G coverage, English increasingly common. But still rough edges—potholed roads outside Yerevan, Soviet-era buses. The monasteries are why you're here: Geghard (UNESCO, partially carved into mountain, incredible acoustics), Tatev (perched on cliff, reached by "Wings of Tatev" cable car—world's longest reversible aerial tramway), Khor Virap (Ararat views, where Gregory the Illuminator was imprisoned), Noravank (red rocks, dramatic setting). Lake Sevan: alpine lake at 1,900m, beaches in summer, monastery on peninsula, fresh fish. Dilijan National Park: "Little Switzerland," forested, hiking, Haghartsin Monastery. Winter: Tsaghkadzor ski resort (modest but cheap). Challenges: Azerbaijan conflict shadows everything. Karabakh war in 2020 saw Armenia lose territory, 2023 Azerbaijan took Nagorno-Karabakh entirely, 100K+ Armenians fled. Border tensions persist, occasional skirmishes. Areas near Azerbaijan border off-limits. Infrastructure: flights to Yerevan Zvartnots Airport from Europe (Wizz Air, Ryanair low-cost), Dubai, Moscow. No direct flights from US (connect via Europe). Overland from Georgia easy (Tbilisi-Yerevan marshrutka $10, 6h). Iran border open but requires Iranian visa (hard for Americans). Turkey-Armenia border closed since 1993. Visa: most nationalities visa-free or e-visa on arrival (Americans/EU/Canadians 180 days visa-free!). Entry super easy. Best time: May-Oct (warm, accessible mountains, Sevan swimmable). Nov-Mar cold (Yerevan manageable, mountains snowy/icy). Apr-May wildflowers. Sep-Oct wine harvest. Peak Jul-Aug but not crowded. Safety: very safe. Low crime, friendly people. Women solo travelers report feeling comfortable. Only risk: Azerbaijan border conflict—avoid Tavush, Gegharkunik border areas. Check Ministry Foreign Affairs advisories. Costs: dirt cheap. Hostel $10, hotel $40, meal $15, brandy bottle $10, domestic taxi $3 across Yerevan. Tourism contributes 11% GDP, growing. Government invested in infrastructure, marketing "Stone Age to Space Age" history (claims oldest winery, leather shoe). Russian influx 2022-2023 (fleeing mobilization, sanctions) brought tech workers, digital nomads, driving up Yerevan rents but boosting economy. Hidden gems: Areni wine region (ancient winemaking, cave tastings), Jermuk (spa town, mineral water), Symphony of Stones (basalt column canyon), Amberd Fortress (7th-century, 2,300m altitude, Ararat views). Challenges: landlocked, borders with Turkey/Azerbaijan closed, relies on Georgia/Iran routes. Air Corridor to Russia important but politically complicated. Armenian diaspora outnumbers population (3M in Armenia, 7M+ worldwide), diaspora tourism significant. **Bottom line:** Armenia is Caucasus for people who want Georgia's culture/mountains without the party hostels and crowds. Ancient, authentic, affordable. Monasteries rival anything in Europe, brandy rivals Cognac (they'll fight you on this), and Ararat views break your heart knowing it's in Turkey. Go before the secret's fully out—Russian influx already changing Yerevan. If you like rough edges, Soviet history, and Christian heritage, Armenia delivers.`,

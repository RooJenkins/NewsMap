  { name: 'Austria', lat: 47.5162, lng: 14.5501, summary: `# Austria - Education\n\nAustrian education maintains strong academic tracking—students sorted at age 10 into academic or vocational paths. This system, inherited from the Habsburg era, entrenches class divisions. Recent right-wing governments have resisted comprehensive reform, preferring tradition to equity.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Early Tracking and Class Reproduction\n\nAt age 10, Austrian children are tracked into Gymnasium (university-prep) or vocational schools. Family background predicts outcomes more than ability. This isn't meritocracy—it's inherited privilege.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Immigrant Student Segregation\n\nStudents with migration backgrounds are overrepresented in vocational tracks and underrepresented in Gymnasium. Language barriers are used to justify exclusion rather than addressed through support.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Conservative Resistance to Reform\n\nThe ÖVP-led government defends early tracking as "tradition." Progressive educators demand comprehensive schools that don't segregate 10-year-olds. The battle is ideological.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nFinland abolished tracking and became a global leader. Austria clings to a system designed for aristocratic society. The evidence is clear, but politics blocks change.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nAustrian education could be excellent and equitable. Early tracking must end, immigrant students need support not segregation, and tradition shouldn't trump children's futures.`, issues: ['Early Tracking and Class Reproduction', 'Immigrant Student Segregation', 'Conservative Resistance to Reform'] },

Ostensibly free public schools charge "voluntary" fees that exclude poor families. Inequality is severe and worsening.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Quasi-Privatization Through Fees\n\nPublic schools charge fees for activities, materials, and trips. Poor families can't afford them, creating de facto privatization within the public system.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Linguistic Division and Inequality\n\nFlemish and French systems operate independently with different standards. Coordination is minimal. Students in Wallonia lag those in Flanders, reflecting regional economic disparities.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Immigrant and Minority Segregation\n\nBrussels schools are highly segregated by ethnicity and class. Immigrant children cluster in underfunded schools while Belgian children attend better-resourced institutions.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nBelgium's inequality belies its wealthy status. The OECD data shows Belgium among the most unequal education systems in Europe.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nBelgium needs truly free public schools, coordination between linguistic communities, and desegregation policies.

Political instability prevents sustained reform.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Roma Educational Exclusion\n\nRoma children face systematic discrimination—segregated schools, lower expectations, and exclusion from quality education. This is apartheid.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Teacher Emigration Crisis\n\nBulgarian teachers earn a fraction of Western European salaries. Thousands emigrate annually. Rural schools can't recruit teachers.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Underfunding and Corruption\n\nEducation spending is among the EU's lowest. Corruption diverts resources. Students suffer.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nBulgaria's brain drain to Western Europe is accelerated by education failures. Investing in schools would retain talent.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nBulgaria needs Roma inclusion, teacher salary increases, and anti-corruption measures.

Progressive educators resist, but political pressure is intense.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Catholic Church in Public Schools\n\nReligious education in public schools privileges Catholicism, marginalizing Orthodox, Muslim, and secular families.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Youth Emigration\n\nCroatia's youth emigrate to Western Europe for opportunities. Education can't compensate for economic stagnation.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nCroatia's EU accession raised hopes for investment.

Little has changed.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Teacher Pay and Strikes\n\nTeachers strike regularly for salaries competitive with other professions. The government offers minimal increases. Recruitment is difficult.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Tuition Debate at Universities\n\nRight-wing parties propose tuition fees at public universities, currently free. Students and faculty mobilize against this.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nThe Czech Republic risks following Poland and Hungary into nationalist, privatized education. Resistance is crucial.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe Czech Republic must enforce Roma inclusion, raise teacher salaries, and defend free higher education.

But anti-immigrant policies, including separate schools for refugee children, threaten this inclusive tradition.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Ghetto Laws and Segregation\n\nDenmark's "ghetto" laws mandate dispersal of immigrant families and separate schooling. This abandons integration for segregation.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Standardized Testing Creep\n\nDenmark is importing Anglo-American testing obsession, undermining its tradition of holistic assessment.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Teacher Workload and Burnout\n\n2013 reforms increased teacher hours without pay raises. Morale declined, and recruitment suffered.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nDenmark's rightward shift mirrors European trends.

This harms learning outcomes.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Tech-Solutionism\n\nEstonia's digital education is impressive but overemphasized. Technology can't replace well-paid, respected teachers.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Privatization Proposals\n\nNeoliberal voices push vouchers and private schools. Estonia's success came from strong public investment—privatization would undermine it.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nEstonia proves small countries can lead through public investment. Its success should inspire, not be dismantled.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nEstonia should support bilingual education for Russian speakers, maintain teacher investment, and resist privatization.`, issues: ['Russian-Language School Phase-Out', 'Tech-Solutionism', 'Privatization Proposals'] },

Language support is inadequate.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Creeping Privatization\n\nFor-profit education companies are entering Finland, promoting digital learning platforms. The government must regulate.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Complacency and Underfunding\n\nFinland is coasting on past success. Recent PISA declines reflect stagnant investment. Continued excellence requires continued commitment.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nFinland's model—trust teachers, minimize testing, fund equitably—works.

But reality diverges: growing inequality, suburban school segregation, and battles over secularism vs. religious expression reveal deep tensions.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Suburban School Crisis\n\nSchools in banlieues (suburbs) with immigrant populations are underfunded, overcrowded, and teacher-starved. The republican ideal of equality is hollow for these students.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Hijab Bans and Secular Extremism\n\nFrance bans religious symbols in schools, disproportionately affecting Muslim girls. This isn't secularism—it's exclusion. Many Muslim students drop out or attend private religious schools.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Grandes Écoles and Elite Reproduction\n\nFrance's elite Grandes Écoles perpetuate class privilege. Admission is nearly impossible for working-class students. Meritocracy is a myth.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nFrance's rigid secularism and elite tracking contrast with Nordic flexibility and equity.

But early tracking (age 10-12), immigrant student segregation, and Bavarian conservatism create inequality.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Three-Tier Tracking and Class Reproduction\n\nGermany sorts children at 10-12 into Gymnasium, Realschule, or Hauptschule. This entrenches class and immigrant status. Berlin's comprehensive schools outperform, but Bavaria resists reform.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Turkish and Syrian Student Exclusion\n\nStudents with migration backgrounds are underrepresented in Gymnasium and universities. Language is used to exclude, not integrate.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Eastern Germany Teacher Shortages\n\nFormer East Germany faces acute teacher shortages and far-right infiltration of schools. The federal government's response is inadequate.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nGermany's vocational system is admired, but early tracking is not. Finland's comprehensive model produces better, more equitable outcomes.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nGermany should delay tracking, support immigrant students, and address East Germany's crisis.

Hungary is a cautionary tale of education under illiberalism.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Central European University Expulsion\n\nOrbán forced CEU, one of Europe's finest universities, to leave Hungary. This was political retaliation against George Soros and academic freedom.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Nationalist Curriculum and Revisionism\n\nHistory curricula now glorify Hungarian nationalism and downplay Roma genocide and Jewish suffering. Critical thinking is replaced with propaganda.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Teacher Strikes and Repression\n\nTeachers who strike face dismissal. The government criminalizes dissent and controls curricula centrally.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nHungary's authoritarianism is exported to Poland and mimicked by right-wing parties globally.

This violates secular families' rights and perpetuates religious dominance over public life.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Catholic Church Control of Schools\n\nCatholic Church owns and operates most schools, funded by the state. Non-Catholic families face limited options. This is inappropriate in a diverse society.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Teacher Housing Crisis\n\nIreland's housing costs make teaching unaffordable in Dublin and Cork. Teachers commute hours or leave the profession.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: University Funding Crisis\n\nIrish universities are chronically underfunded. Brain drain to UK and US is severe. Quality is declining.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nIreland's Church-state education relationship is anachronistic.

This reflects regional economic inequality and unequal school funding.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Teacher Precarity and Low Pay\n\nItalian teachers earn among the lowest salaries in Western Europe. Many work on short-term contracts for years. Recruitment crisis is severe.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Catholic Church Influence\n\nReligious education is mandatory unless parents opt out. This privileges Catholicism and marginalizes other traditions.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nItaly's brain drain to Northern Europe accelerates.

Countries considering vouchers should study Sweden's failure.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nSweden must phase out vouchers, regulate or eliminate for-profit schools, and reinvest in public education. Ideology shouldn't trump evidence.`, issues: ['Voucher System's Failure', 'For-Profit School Bankruptcies', 'Immigrant Student Segregation'] },

  { name: 'Switzerland', lat: 46.8182, lng: 8.2275, summary: `# Switzerland - Education\n\nSwiss education is highly decentralized by canton, well-funded, and includes strong vocational tracks. But tracking at age 12, immigrant exclusion, and linguistic divisions create inequality.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Early Tracking and Class Reproduction\n\nAt age 12, Swiss students are tracked. Family background overwhelmingly determines outcomes. This entrenches privilege.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Immigrant Student Exclusion\n\nStudents with migration backgrounds are underrepresented in academic tracks and universities. Language barriers justify exclusion rather than trigger support.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Cantonal Inequality\n\nWealthy cantons like Zurich have excellent schools. Poorer cantons struggle. National coordination is minimal.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nSwitzerland's wealth doesn't guarantee equity. Early tracking undermines meritocracy despite Swiss myths of fairness.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nSwitzerland should delay tracking, support immigrant students, and ensure cantonal equity. Wealth should enable justice, not excuse inequality.`, issues: ['Early Tracking and Class Reproduction', 'Immigrant Student Exclusion', 'Cantonal Inequality'] },

  { name: 'Turkey', lat: 38.9637, lng: 35.2433, summary: `# Turkey - Education\n\nTurkish education under Erdoğan has become increasingly Islamist and authoritarian. Secular curricula are replaced with religious instruction, Kurdish education is suppressed, and academic freedom is crushed.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Islamization of Curricula\n\nErdoğan has expanded religious education, reduced evolution teaching, and promoted Ottoman history glorification. Secular education is under assault.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Kurdish Language Education Banned\n\nKurdish-language education is prohibited. Students are punished for speaking Kurdish. This is cultural suppression.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Academic Purges and Repression\n\nThousands of academics have been fired, arrested, or forced into exile for criticizing Erdoğan. Universities are controlled by loyalists.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nTurkey's authoritarian turn mirrors Russia and Hungary. Education becomes indoctrination.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nTurkish education requires democratic restoration, secular curricula, Kurdish language rights, and academic freedom. Current path leads to intellectual stagnation.`, issues: ['Islamization of Curricula', 'Kurdish Language Education Banned', 'Academic Purges and Repression'] },

  { name: 'Ukraine', lat: 48.3794, lng: 31.1656, summary: `# Ukraine - Education\n\nUkrainian education has been devastated by war. Schools are bombed, millions displaced, teachers killed. Yet educators continue teaching—in basements, online, in refugee camps—demonstrating extraordinary resilience.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: War's Destruction of Schools\n\nRussia has bombed over 3,000 Ukrainian schools. Millions of children have had education interrupted. This is a war crime.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Displaced Students and Refugee Education\n\nOver 5 million Ukrainian children are displaced internally or abroad. Refugee education is inconsistent across host countries.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Teacher Heroism and Trauma\n\nUkrainian teachers continue teaching under bombardment, in occupied territories, in exile. Many suffer trauma. Support is inadequate.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nEuropean countries host Ukrainian refugees but provide inconsistent education access. International support is crucial.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nUkraine's education recovery requires international solidarity—funding for school rebuilding, teacher support, and refugee education. Ukrainian resilience deserves support, not rhetoric.`, issues: ['War's Destruction of Schools', 'Displaced Students and Refugee Education', 'Teacher Heroism and Trauma'] },

  { name: 'United Kingdom', lat: 55.3781, lng: -3.4360, summary: `# United Kingdom - Education\n\nUK education has been ravaged by Tory austerity, academization (privatization by another name), and Brexit disruption. Teachers strike for pay, schools crumble literally, and inequality widens.\n\n## The Big Issue 1: Academy Schools and Privatization\n\nAcademies—publicly funded but privately run schools—have proliferated. Many are owned by chains that extract fees and prioritize profit. This is privatization disguised as reform.\n\n## The Big Issue 2: Teacher Pay Crisis and Strikes\n\nReal teacher wages have fallen 15% since 2010. Recruitment is collapsing. Teachers across England struck in 2025 demanding fair pay. The government's response: minimal raises and accusations of selfishness.\n\n## The Big Issue 3: Crumbling School Infrastructure\n\nOver 700 schools have dangerous concrete requiring emergency repairs. The government knew for years but didn't act. Students learn in unsafe buildings.\n\n## The International Angle\n\nUK's academization model has been exported globally. The evidence of failure is clear, yet ideology persists.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nUK needs to reverse academization, pay teachers fairly, and repair school infrastructure. Austerity has failed. Investment in public education is urgent.`, issues: ['Academy Schools and Privatization', 'Teacher Pay Crisis and Strikes', 'Crumbling School Infrastructure'] }

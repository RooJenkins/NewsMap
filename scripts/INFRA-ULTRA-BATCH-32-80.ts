  {name: 'Spain',lat: 40.4637,lng: -3.7492,summary: "Spain's infrastructure represents one of Europe's most remarkable transformations over the past four decades. The country has built Europe's most extensive high-speed rail network after France, modernized its highway systems, and developed urban infrastructure that has fundamentally altered quality of life in major cities. The AVE high-speed rail connects Madrid to Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, Málaga, and other cities at 300 km/h. Urban metro systems in Madrid and Barcelona rank among Europe's finest. However, this infrastructure boom, largely financed through debt and EU funds, created systems expensive to maintain while serving a population distributed in ways that challenge efficient operation. Some infrastructure investments were politically driven rather than economically justified, creating ghost airports and underutilized rail lines.\n\nThe highway network includes comprehensive autopista toll roads connecting all regions with generally excellent quality. However, some privately operated toll roads faced financial difficulties when traffic fell below projections. The infrastructure exists but utilization on some routes hasn't justified investment. Non-toll national highways provide alternatives with longer travel times. Airport infrastructure was massively expanded during the pre-2008 boom, producing excess capacity. Regional airports in Ciudad Real, Castellón, and other locations became notorious examples of overinvestment - facilities built with little realistic demand assessment. These ghost airports represent infrastructure divorced from economic fundamentals.\n\nPort infrastructure at Valencia, Algeciras, and Barcelona ranks among Europe's busiest container ports with modern, efficient facilities. Digital infrastructure provides extensive fiber coverage in urban areas with 4G networks covering most of the country. Energy infrastructure has shifted substantially toward renewables with extensive wind and solar deployment, though the grid requires ongoing investment to manage variable renewable generation.",issues: ['High-speed rail network operating below capacity on some routes','Excess airport infrastructure from pre-recession overbuilding','Public transit financing sustainability challenges','Infrastructure maintenance costs straining budgets','Regional infrastructure disparities']},
  {name: 'Poland',lat: 51.9194,lng: 19.1451,summary: "Poland's infrastructure has been transformed by EU membership and funding that enabled massive investment in highways, railways, airports, and urban transit. The highway network expanded from minimal motorways in 2004 to comprehensive coverage connecting all major cities. Railway infrastructure received investment for track upgrades and new rolling stock, though progress has been uneven with some lines modernized while others remain slow and outdated. Warsaw's metro system has been extended, and other cities developed tram networks. However, the infrastructure challenges remain substantial - many roads outside main corridors need upgrading, rail infrastructure requires continued modernization, and urban transit in cities beyond Warsaw often remains inadequate. The end of peak EU funding creates questions about sustaining infrastructure investment momentum.\n\nThe highway network's expansion represents Poland's most visible infrastructure achievement. Motorways now connect Warsaw to Gdańsk, Poznań, Wrocław, Kraków, and borders with Germany and Czech Republic. The infrastructure was built rapidly using EU funds and public-private partnerships. However, quality has varied, with some sections requiring early repairs. Secondary roads often remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Railway infrastructure has seen selective modernization - the Warsaw-Kraków-Katowice corridor has upgraded track enabling higher speeds, but many regional lines operate with aging infrastructure and slow speeds. The challenge is completing modernization across the entire network rather than just priority corridors.\n\nWarsaw's metro system has been expanded with new lines serving more of the city, though coverage remains limited compared to Western European capitals. The tram network supplements metro service. Other major cities have tram or bus infrastructure but lack metro systems. Urban transit infrastructure has improved but often struggles with crowding and inadequate frequency. The rapid motorization as incomes rose has created congestion that transit infrastructure hasn't fully addressed.\n\nAirport infrastructure at Warsaw Chopin and regional airports has been modernized and expanded. The infrastructure serves both business travel and the large Polish diaspora in Western Europe. Low-cost carriers have driven traffic growth that infrastructure has generally accommodated. Energy infrastructure has been modernized with new power plants, though Poland remains heavily dependent on coal for electricity generation. The transition to renewables has been slower than Western Europe, requiring substantial infrastructure investment in coming decades. Digital infrastructure has developed well with expanding fiber networks and 4G coverage, though rural areas have gaps.",issues: ['Railway modernization incomplete beyond main corridors','Urban transit infrastructure inadequate in cities beyond Warsaw','Secondary road network requiring continued upgrades','Coal-dependent energy infrastructure requiring transition','Sustaining infrastructure investment as EU funding decreases']},
  {name: 'Ukraine',lat: 48.3794,lng: 31.1656,summary: "Ukraine's infrastructure has been devastated by Russia's 2022 invasion and ongoing war, with systematic destruction of energy systems, bridges, rail lines, and civilian infrastructure constituting war crimes. Before the invasion, Ukraine's infrastructure reflected Soviet-era systems that had seen minimal modernization - aging railways operating with outdated equipment, roads in poor condition, and electricity infrastructure requiring massive investment. The war has destroyed power generation capacity, damaged the grid extensively, and targeted heating infrastructure to terrorize civilians through winter. Reconstruction will require hundreds of billions of dollars and decades of work, if security conditions ever stabilize to enable sustained investment.\n\nThe railway network, inherited from the Soviet era, operated extensive passenger and freight service but with aging infrastructure. The broad gauge tracks differ from European standard gauge, requiring cargo transfer at borders. Before the war, gradual modernization was occurring, but progress was slow. The war has damaged tracks, stations, and rolling stock extensively, particularly in eastern and southern Ukraine. Yet the railways have proven remarkably resilient, continuing to evacuate civilians and move military supplies despite attacks.\n\nRoad infrastructure was generally poor before the invasion, with many highways in deteriorated condition. Corruption and limited resources meant maintenance was inadequate. The war has damaged or destroyed numerous bridges and road sections. Urban infrastructure in Mariupol, Kharkiv, and other cities has been systematically destroyed through shelling and bombardment. Apartment blocks, water systems, and sewage infrastructure have been targeted or suffered collateral damage.\n\nEnergy infrastructure has been the primary target of Russian attacks, with systematic strikes on power generation facilities and the electrical grid. The attacks have left millions without power during winter, constituting collective punishment of civilians. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, was seized by Russian forces and operated under dangerous conditions with shelling risks. Reconstruction of energy infrastructure will be one of the most critical post-war priorities.",issues: ['Systematic war destruction of energy infrastructure','Railway and road infrastructure damaged by fighting','Urban infrastructure destroyed in occupied and contested areas','Soviet-era systems requiring modernization before war struck','Reconstruction requiring hundreds of billions unavailable']},
  {name: 'Russia',lat: 61.5240,lng: 105.3188,summary: "Russia's infrastructure reflects both Soviet-era achievements and post-Soviet decay, with dramatic contrasts between showcase Moscow projects and deteriorating provincial systems. Moscow's metro, one of the world's most beautiful and extensive, receives ongoing investment while regional cities struggle with aging trolleybuses and potholed roads. The Trans-Siberian Railway represents historical infrastructure ambition, yet track conditions and service quality have declined from Soviet standards. Highway infrastructure remains inadequate for the world's largest country - many regions lack paved roads, and even federal highways often have poor pavement and limited lanes. Sanctions from the Ukraine invasion have complicated infrastructure projects requiring Western technology. The petrostate economy has enabled some infrastructure investment, yet corruption diverts resources while political priorities favor prestige projects over systematic improvement.\n\nThe railway network covers vast distances with the Trans-Siberian and other routes connecting Europe to the Pacific across 9,000+ kilometers. However, much infrastructure dates from Soviet times with limited modernization. Passenger trains are often slow with aging rolling stock. Freight rail moves substantial cargo but infrastructure constraints limit capacity and speed. The Moscow-St. Petersburg route has higher-speed Sapsan trains, but most of the network operates far below modern standards. Railway infrastructure requires massive investment to modernize, yet resources have been limited and sanctions restrict access to advanced train technology.\n\nMoscow's infrastructure showcases state investment - the metro continues expanding with ornate stations, highways have been built or widened, and public spaces renovated. However, this creates stark contrast with regional cities where infrastructure is often decrepit. St. Petersburg has metro and some modern infrastructure, but beyond the two capitals, urban infrastructure often remains Soviet-era or worse. The centralization of resources in Moscow creates infrastructure inequality that mirrors political and economic centralization.\n\nHighway infrastructure is inadequate across most of the country. The federal highway network has improved on some routes, but many roads remain two-lane, poorly maintained, or unpaved. The notorious 'roads and fools' saying reflects infrastructure failures that constrain development. Siberian and Far Eastern regions often lack paved road connections, depending on rivers or seasonal ice roads.\n\nAirport infrastructure in Moscow includes Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, and Vnukovo serving international and domestic traffic. Regional airports vary from adequate facilities to barely functional terminals. The vast distances make air travel crucial, yet infrastructure outside major cities is often minimal. Energy infrastructure includes extensive oil and gas production and pipeline systems that export to Europe and Asia. However, the electrical grid has seen limited investment, and power outages occur even in major cities. Sanctions affecting gas exports to Europe create strategic infrastructure challenges.",issues: ['Highway infrastructure inadequate outside major routes','Railway network requiring massive modernization','Stark Moscow versus regional infrastructure inequality','Sanctions restricting access to advanced infrastructure technology','Corruption diverting resources from systematic infrastructure improvement']},
  {name: 'Turkey',lat: 38.9637,lng: 35.2433,summary: "Turkey's infrastructure has been transformed under two decades of AKP government prioritizing mega-projects - new highways, bridges, airports, and high-speed rail. Istanbul's third airport became the world's largest by terminal area, the Marmaray tunnel connects Europe and Asia by rail under the Bosphorus, and new highways span the country. However, this infrastructure boom relied heavily on debt, often through currency-mismatched borrowing that became problematic when the lira collapsed. Questions about project selection, procurement transparency, and economic justification have emerged. Some infrastructure serves genuine needs while other projects appear politically motivated. The economic crisis has constrained resources for maintenance and new projects, creating uncertainty about sustaining infrastructure development.\n\nThe highway network has been massively expanded with new motorways connecting all regions. The infrastructure quality is generally good on main routes, though secondary roads vary. Bridge infrastructure includes dramatic projects like the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge, the world's longest suspension span. However, the toll requirements and debt servicing for these projects create fiscal pressures. High-speed rail connects Ankara to Istanbul and other cities with trains operating at 250 km/h on dedicated infrastructure. The network continues expanding, though slower than initial ambitions. Conventional rail infrastructure has seen less investment, with many lines operating with aging equipment.\n\nIstanbul's infrastructure challenges are immense - a metropolitan area of over 15 million people sprawling across two continents. The metro system has been expanded extensively with new lines, yet coverage remains inadequate for the city's size. The Marmaray tunnel enables through-rail service connecting Asian and European suburbs via tunnel under the Bosphorus. Traffic congestion remains severe despite infrastructure investment, as vehicle ownership grows faster than road and transit capacity. Bridges across the Bosphorus handle enormous traffic volumes but become bottlenecks during peak times.\n\nIstanbul Airport, opened in 2018, provides massive capacity with infrastructure designed for up to 200 million passengers annually. The facility replaced Atatürk Airport with a purpose-built hub far from the city center. The infrastructure is impressive but the location requires long access times. Regional airports have been built or upgraded across the country, serving both domestic travel and tourism.\n\nEnergy infrastructure includes extensive natural gas pipelines making Turkey a transit route for energy to Europe. Hydroelectric dams provide substantial generation, supplemented by coal and increasing renewable energy. The grid infrastructure generally provides reliable service, though the economic crisis has created challenges in securing fuel for generation. Digital infrastructure provides good mobile coverage with expanding fiber networks in cities, though rural areas have gaps.",issues: ['Infrastructure debt from mega-projects straining fiscal capacity','Economic crisis constraining maintenance and new investment','Project selection driven by politics rather than pure economics','Istanbul infrastructure struggling to keep pace with growth','Currency crisis affecting ability to service foreign-currency infrastructure debt']},
  {name: 'Greece',lat: 39.0742,lng: 21.8243,summary: "Greece's infrastructure reflects a country that invested heavily with EU funds and Olympics preparation, then faced devastating fiscal crisis that constrained maintenance and new investment. The Athens metro built for the 2004 Olympics provides modern urban rail infrastructure, highways connect regions with generally good quality, and ports serve crucial maritime economy. However, the debt crisis forced austerity that slashed infrastructure budgets, creating maintenance backlogs and halting projects mid-construction. Railway infrastructure received minimal investment, declining to unreliable service. The economic recovery has enabled resumed infrastructure investment, yet the massive public debt limits available resources. EU funding provides crucial support, but Greece's fiscal constraints mean infrastructure needs often exceed available resources.\n\nThe highway network includes motorways connecting Athens to Thessaloniki and other major cities, generally well-maintained through toll concessions. However, secondary roads often have quality issues. Mountainous terrain makes infrastructure expensive to build and maintain. The economic crisis meant deferred maintenance on many roads. Railway infrastructure represents a major deficit - the network is aging and unreliable, with frequent delays and cancellations. The Athens-Thessaloniki route takes over 4 hours for 500km, far too slow. Privatization and infrastructure investment have been discussed but implementation has been limited.\n\nAthens' metro system, built for the Olympics with archaeological discoveries incorporated into station designs, provides excellent urban transit. However, the city's broader public transport struggles with financial pressures affecting service quality. Other Greek cities have minimal transit infrastructure beyond buses. Port infrastructure serves the merchant marine and island ferry systems crucial for Greek geography. Piraeus has been developed by Chinese investment into a major Mediterranean transshipment hub. The infrastructure quality has improved substantially. Island ports vary from modern facilities on major islands to basic harbors on smaller ones.\n\nAirport infrastructure at Athens International provides modern facilities serving tourism and diaspora travel. Island airports are crucial for tourism, with infrastructure ranging from international facilities like those in Santorini and Mykonos to small regional airports. Energy infrastructure relies on natural gas imports and oil-fired generation, with renewable energy from solar and wind expanding but still representing smaller shares than needed. The grid infrastructure generally provides reliable service. Digital infrastructure has improved with fiber deployment in cities and 4G coverage, though rural and island areas have connectivity gaps.",issues: ['Railway infrastructure severely degraded and unreliable','Debt crisis limiting infrastructure investment capacity','Maintenance backlogs from austerity years','Urban transit infrastructure inadequate outside Athens','Island connectivity requiring ongoing infrastructure investment']},

The challenge is that rail infrastructure requires sustained investment, yet political disagreements and budget constraints have limited resources.\n\nBrussels' urban infrastructure includes metro, tram, and bus systems providing good coverage, though coordination between different operators (serving different linguistic communities) creates complexity. The city's role as EU capital generates substantial traffic that infrastructure struggles to accommodate. Road congestion is severe, yet expanding infrastructure faces space constraints in the dense urban environment. Other cities have tram or bus infrastructure but no metro systems. Antwerp and other cities manage with surface transit that becomes congested.\n\nThe highway network provides comprehensive coverage but faces extreme congestion. Belgium infamously has some of Europe's worst traffic jams, particularly around Brussels and Antwerp. The road infrastructure exists but demand exceeds capacity, creating chronic bottlenecks. The absence of road pricing means congestion rather than tolls manages demand. Port infrastructure at Antwerp provides world-class facilities with automated terminals and excellent hinterland connections. The port ranks second in Europe by tonnage with infrastructure supporting complex logistics operations. Brussels Airport provides the main international gateway with adequate infrastructure.\n\nEnergy infrastructure depends heavily on nuclear power, though the government decided to phase out nuclear plants by 2025, later postponed. The closure timeline has been repeatedly adjusted as the difficulty of replacing baseload nuclear generation becomes clear. The grid infrastructure requires investment to integrate renewable energy and manage the transition from nuclear. Digital infrastructure provides excellent fiber and mobile coverage across the small country.",issues: ['Railway infrastructure reliability issues from deferred maintenance','Chronic highway congestion without effective demand management','Political fragmentation complicating infrastructure planning and funding','Nuclear phase-out creating energy infrastructure transition challenges','Urban transit infrastructure struggling with density and congestion']},

The infrastructure has been gradually modernized with EU funding supporting fleet replacement and some track improvements. However, the city's size (approaching 700,000 metropolitan) arguably could justify light rail or metro infrastructure that doesn't exist. Traffic congestion has increased as car ownership grows. Other Latvian cities have bus infrastructure with some trolleybus systems remaining from Soviet era.\n\nThe highway network includes the Via Baltica route connecting to Lithuania and Estonia upgraded to reasonable standard. However, motorway coverage is limited with most roads being two-lane. EU funding has enabled gradual improvements but comprehensive motorway network exceeds resources. Rural roads vary in quality with winter maintenance creating ongoing costs. The sparse population in much of Latvia makes justifying extensive highway infrastructure difficult.\n\nRiga port provides maritime infrastructure serving both Latvian trade and transit cargo from Belarus and Russia. The port has been developed with private investment creating modern terminals. However, political tensions with Russia have affected transit volumes. Ferry infrastructure connects to Sweden and Germany. Airport infrastructure at Riga provides connections to European cities with adequate facilities after recent expansion. Regional airports have minimal traffic.\n\nEnergy infrastructure includes thermal generation and imports with increasing renewable energy from wind and biomass. The grid connects to Baltic and Nordic markets. The LNG terminal (joint with Estonia and Finland) enables gas imports. Digital infrastructure has developed with fiber networks in Riga and 4G coverage, though rural areas have connectivity gaps.",issues: ['Rail Baltica project critical but facing delays and cost increases','Riga lacking metro despite being largest Baltic capital','Highway network limited beyond main corridors','Declining population questioning infrastructure investment scale','Port infrastructure vulnerable to Russia transit volume fluctuations']}

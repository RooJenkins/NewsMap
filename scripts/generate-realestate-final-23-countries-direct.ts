  'Cameroon': {
    summary: `Cameroon's real estate market is deeply constrained by limited formal housing supply and a two-tiered market system that works decisively against affordability. Yaoundé and Douala have seen prices appreciate dramatically over the past decade—with rent consuming 40-50% of median incomes in prime neighborhoods—while the vast majority of the population lives in informal settlements with zero property rights. The fundamental problem is straightforward: formal development is slow, expensive, and tightly controlled by connected elites. Homeownership among the formal middle class sits around 15-20%, with wealthy families treating real estate as investment vehicles rather than housing solutions. Construction activity does occur but remains concentrated in luxury developments that serve foreign investors and corrupt officials, not ordinary Cameroonians. Zoning regulations exist on paper but mean little in practice—informal neighborhoods like Nylon in Douala have become sprawling, unplanned explosions of corrugated metal and concrete. Transit-oriented development doesn't exist; most people have no choice but to live where they can afford and endure brutal commutes. Real estate speculation is rampant, with land sitting undeveloped for years as investors wait for prices to rise. Homelessness is technically invisible in official statistics but visibly present: street children, displaced persons from insecurity in the northwest, and families in temporary shelters number in the hundreds of thousands. The rental market functions informally, with verbal agreements and zero tenant protections. What's needed is urgent: deregulation of housing development, protection of property rights for informal residents, and investment in transit. Without it, Cameroon will continue producing an underhoused, internally divided city system.`,

  'Zambia': {
    summary: `Zambia's housing crisis reflects a country caught between tradition and rapid urbanization, with Lusaka bearing the brunt. Housing affordability has deteriorated sharply since 2017; median housing costs now consume 45-55% of household incomes in formal areas, while informal settlements house roughly 60% of Lusaka's population. The dream of homeownership remains just that for most Zambians—mortgage availability is minimal and interest rates exceed 20% for those who qualify. Construction activity is present but bifurcated: some formal middle-class development occurs in areas like Rhodes Park, but it's entirely inadequate to demand. Zoning regulations theoretically reserve land for residential use, but enforcement is weak and corruption diverts land to politically connected parties. The overwhelming reality is sprawl: unplanned mushrooming around Lusaka's periphery where families self-build on illegally subdivided plots. Transit doesn't really exist—most people walk or depend on minibuses that randomly traverse the city. Real estate investors from South Africa and China increasingly buy property, driving up prices and removing units from owner-occupation. Homelessness, while less visible than street sleeping in developed countries, is significant: hundreds of children sleep rough, and families fleeing domestic violence occupy informal structures. Rental markets function informally with minimal tenant rights. What Zambia desperately needs is recognition that supply-side constraints—not demand—are the problem. That means liberalizing residential zoning, formalizing informal settlements through title programs, and building basic infrastructure. Without serious supply expansion, housing costs will continue squeezing low-income families and driving them into ever-more precarious informal arrangements.`,

  },

  'Mali': {
    summary: `Mali's housing sector exists in a state of fragmentation that borders on dysfunctional, exacerbated by persistent insecurity and government weakness. Bamako's formal housing market is minuscule: perhaps 5-10% of the population lives in regulated, titled properties with standard construction. The remaining 90% occupies informal dwellings ranging from mud-brick compounds to makeshift structures in sprawling settlements. Affordability is meaningless as a concept when formal housing simply doesn't exist at scales relevant to ordinary people. Homeownership rates among the formal middle class sit around 8-12%, but these are largely self-built properties without legal documentation. Rental markets operate entirely informally with unwritten agreements and zero dispute resolution mechanisms. New construction is happening, but sporadically and concentrated among wealthy merchants and foreign investors seeking to park capital abroad. Zoning doesn't function meaningfully—Bamako has sprawled chaotically without planning or basic infrastructure. Density varies wildly: dense informal compounds sit adjacent to sprawling low-rise areas, with no coherent pattern. Transit-oriented development is nonexistent; transportation consists of private taxis, donkey carts, and walking. Real estate speculation exists but is modest because property rights are tenuous and political instability discourages investment. Homelessness is significant: drought, conflict displacement, and poverty push thousands into street situations, particularly affecting children. The rental problem is acute for the poorest; families pay 50-60% of income for one-room informal rentals. What Mali needs is fundamental institutional building—land registries that actually function, courts that enforce contracts, security that allows investment. These preconditions are currently absent. Until them, housing will remain a luxury for the connected and a source of desperation for everyone else.`,

  },

  'Niger': {
    summary: `Niger presents a housing crisis amplified by extreme poverty, rapid population growth, and weak state capacity. Niamey's housing market exists almost entirely in the informal realm, with perhaps 95% of the population living in unregulated, untitled properties. Affordability is not the issue—availability is. The city population has doubled in 20 years, vastly outpacing housing construction, resulting in severe overcrowding and deteriorating conditions. Homeownership among the poor is technically universal in the sense that most people own their informal dwelling, but without legal title or security. Mortgage markets don't exist; banks won't lend on property without documented collateral. Construction occurs sporadically, driven by individual self-building efforts and occasional expatriate-funded developments. Zoning is essentially theoretical—Niamey sprawls across the landscape with minimal planning or infrastructure coordination. Density varies from extremely dense informal compounds in central areas to lower-density peripheral sprawl. Transit-oriented development doesn't exist; transportation is by foot or informal taxis. Real estate speculation is minimal because security is poor and property rights are too tenuous. Homelessness is widespread: thousands of street children, displaced persons from insecurity in the north, and families living in temporary shelters. Rental markets function informally with rents consuming 40-50% of incomes for the poorest households. The humanitarian angle cannot be overstated—housing instability directly correlates with higher mortality, malnutrition, and educational dropout. Niger needs urgent investment in basic infrastructure, land administration systems, and security. Without these foundations, housing will remain a crisis.`,

  },

  'Chad': {
    summary: `Chad's housing sector is characterized by extraordinary informality and insecurity that makes normal real estate markets impossible. N'Djamena, the capital, has expanded chaotically from roughly 400,000 people in 1990 to over 1.2 million today, with housing supply chronically inadequate. Formal housing constitutes perhaps 10-15% of the total stock—mostly concentrated among government officials, wealthy merchants, and foreigners. The vast majority lives in informal structures: mud-brick compounds, straw huts, and makeshift shelters. Affordability is meaningless when supply is so constrained; median rents consume 50-60% of formal-sector incomes. Homeownership exists only among the relatively wealthy and those with connections enabling them to claim land. Construction is sporadic and informal, driven by individual effort rather than organized development. Zoning regulations exist on paper but have zero enforcement capacity. The city sprawls without planning, producing patterns of chaotic density and random spacing. Transit doesn't exist; people walk or use minibuses on unpaved streets. Real estate speculation is minimal because property rights are insecure and conflict risks are real. Homelessness is significant: street children, displaced persons from the Sahel region, and families fleeing violence occupy informal shelters. Rentals are informal with no protections. The underlying constraint is political instability and weak state capacity. Until Chad achieves more stable governance and invests in basic services, housing will remain a source of desperation rather than opportunity.`,

  },

  'Burkina Faso': {
    summary: `Burkina Faso's housing market is being reshaped by conflict and climate stress in ways that are fundamentally destabilizing. Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso have experienced rapid growth over the past 15 years, but housing supply has not kept pace. Affordability has deteriorated sharply: formal-sector workers spend 40-50% of income on rent in developed neighborhoods. Homeownership is concentrated among the wealthy and government connected; for ordinary workers, ownership remains out of reach due to absent mortgage markets and inability to document land claims. Construction activity is divided: some middle-class residential development occurs, but it's dwarfed by informal self-building. Zoning regulations theoretically exist but enforcement is spotty, leading to mixed-use sprawl around city peripheries. Density is highly variable—dense compounds in central areas give way to lower-density informal sprawl on the edges. Transit-oriented development is absent; transportation is by foot, bicycle, or informal taxis. Real estate speculation is increasing as wealthy investors position themselves for long-term growth, pricing ordinary residents further out. Homelessness is rising due to conflict displacement: terrorists and intercommunal violence have driven hundreds of thousands into the cities, overwhelming informal settlements. Rental markets are informal with minimal tenant protections. The refugee and internally displaced crisis is making homelessness visible—informal camps have swollen. Burkina urgently needs housing policy that addresses displacement, liberalizes residential land use, and attracts investment in middle-income housing stock. Without it, the conflict-displacement crisis will deepen housing precarity.`,
    issues: ['Displacement from conflict driving demand', 'Informal rental markets inadequate', 'Zoning enforcement weak', 'Affordability deteriorating', 'Refugee camps expanding']
  },

  'Rwanda': {
    summary: `Rwanda's real estate market is unusual in Africa: relatively formalized, growing, and increasingly expensive. Kigali has transformed from a war-devastated city of 300,000 in 2000 to over 1.2 million today, with housing supply struggling to keep pace. The government's Vision 2020 framework emphasizes formal development, and this shows—perhaps 40-50% of housing in Kigali meets formal standards compared to 5-10% in comparable African cities. Homeownership is actively promoted; government policies support home buyers through land programs and credit initiatives. The housing market has become increasingly attractive to regional investors, driving prices up sharply—median rents in central neighborhoods now consume 35-45% of formal-sector incomes. Construction activity is robust: private developers build continuously, though production remains below demand. Zoning is relatively well-enforced, producing more organized city patterns than most African capitals. Transit-oriented development is emerging: Kigali's master plan envisions neighborhood clustering around commercial nodes. Density varies from high-rise development in central areas to lower-density sprawl in peripheral zones. Real estate speculation is significant and rising: Rwandan and international investors purchase property for appreciation, which helps finance new construction but also drives up prices. Homelessness is less visible than elsewhere in the region—official statistics report it as minimal, though informal researchers document higher numbers. Rental markets are becoming formalized with written agreements becoming more common. The concern is inequality: Rwanda's housing boom has created a sophisticated market, but ordinary workers are increasingly priced out. Without deliberate effort to preserve affordable housing supply, Rwanda risks replicating developed-country housing crises with formalization and price appreciation. What's working is government commitment to formalization and development. What's missing is social housing and protections for renters.`,
    issues: ['Rapid price appreciation outpacing wage growth', 'Affordability declining among workers', 'Speculation increasing', 'Rental market formalizing but expensive', 'Social housing limited']
  },

  'Botswana': {
    summary: `Botswana's real estate market is the most developed in southern Africa outside South Africa, reflecting higher incomes and stronger institutions. Gaborone and other urban centers have relatively formalized housing markets with documented titles, organized development, and functioning credit systems. Homeownership is accessible for the middle class; mortgage availability from banks is reasonable by African standards. Housing affordability, while not crisis-level, has deteriorated over the past decade as prices have appreciated 4-5% annually. Construction activity is steady and professional: private developers build middle-class housing continuously, though supply has not kept pace with demand from rural-urban migration. Zoning regulations are enforced reasonably well, producing more planned city development than is typical in the region. Transit-oriented development is limited; Botswana's development pattern remains car-dependent with minimal public transportation. Density is relatively low; Botswana's wealthier status enables sprawl rather than requiring dense development. Real estate speculation is present, with investment property purchases increasing, but it's not yet a dominant force. Homelessness is less visible than in poorer countries, but informal settlements house perhaps 15-20% of urban populations. Rental markets are increasingly formal with written agreements standard in middle-class areas, though informal rentals remain common at lower income levels. The vulnerability is: without deliberate policy to build low-income housing, Botswana's relative prosperity could produce American-style sprawl and affordability crises. What's working is institutional capacity and credit availability. What's needed is intentional affordable housing policy and mixed-income development.`,
    issues: ['Affordability declining for workers', 'Sprawl pattern emerging', 'Low-income housing shortage', 'Informal settlements growing', 'Speculation increasing moderately']
  },

  'Namibia': {
    summary: `Namibia's housing sector reflects relative prosperity but high inequality in ways that create a fragmented market. Windhoek and other urban centers have formal housing markets with documented titles and organized development, but ownership is heavily concentrated among the white minority. Homeownership rates overall are modest (25-30%), but they mask stark racial inequalities: white homeownership exceeds 50%, while black homeownership remains around 15%. Affordability is poor for the majority; formal housing costs consume 40-50% of household incomes. Construction activity is present but inadequate to demand; some speculative development occurs, particularly in upscale areas. Zoning is enforced, producing relatively organized city patterns, but zoning itself often restricts housing to lower-density patterns that exacerbate affordability problems. Transit-oriented development doesn't exist; transportation is car-dependent. Density is low; Namibia's wealth enables sprawl. Real estate speculation is modest; investment property purchases are increasing but haven't yet become dominant. Homelessness is visible: squatter settlements like Katutura remain massive informal housing concentrations, with rough sleeping increasing. Rental markets vary; formal rentals with written agreements are standard in middle-class areas, but informal rentals predominate at lower incomes. The persistent problem is that post-apartheid land reform has failed to substantially redistribute property. Government land programs exist but are underfunded and slow. Without serious effort to break historical inequality in property ownership, Namibia risks entrenching wealth disparities in housing. What's needed is land redistribution that actually transfers productive assets, affordable housing construction, and policies that open development to previously excluded communities.`,
    issues: ['Racial inequality in homeownership', 'Land reform inadequate', 'Informal settlements large', 'Affordability poor for majority', 'Developer focus on luxury']
  },

  'Madagascar': {
    summary: `Madagascar's real estate market is one of Africa's least developed, reflecting weak institutions and endemic poverty. Antananarivo and other urban centers lack formalized housing markets; perhaps 5-10% of urban housing has documented titles. The majority of Madagascans live in informal, self-built structures without legal security. Affordability is meaningless as a concept—formal housing simply doesn't exist at prices ordinary people can pay. Homeownership in the formal sense is minimal; most people occupy informal dwellings they've built on family or disputed land. Mortgages are effectively unavailable; banks require property documentation that most Madagascans cannot provide. Construction is entirely informal and self-driven; organized development is minimal. Zoning doesn't function meaningfully. Cities sprawl chaotically without planning or infrastructure. Density varies from extremely dense central compounds to lower-density peripheral sprawl. Transit-oriented development doesn't exist; transportation is by foot or informal taxi. Real estate speculation is minimal because property rights are too tenuous and capital markets are underdeveloped. Homelessness is significant: street children, displaced persons, and families in temporary structures number in the tens of thousands. Rental markets function entirely informally with rents consuming 50-60% of the poorest households' incomes. The underlying constraint is institutional failure: no functioning land registry, no courts that enforce contracts, and no credit system. Until Madagascar's government invests in basic institutional development, housing will remain a source of vulnerability rather than wealth accumulation.`,
    issues: ['No functioning land registry', '95% informal housing', 'Mortgages unavailable', 'Urban sprawl unplanned', 'Homelessness visible and growing']

  'Malawi': {
    summary: `Malawi's housing sector reflects acute poverty and rapid urbanization that have created severe supply constraints. Lilongwe and Blantyre have seen populations double since 2000, but housing construction has not kept pace. Formal housing constitutes perhaps 15-20% of urban stock; the remainder is informal, inadequate, and insecure. Affordability is critical: formal-sector rents consume 45-55% of household incomes, forcing most people into informal settlements. Homeownership among the poor is technically common—people build their own dwellings—but without legal title or security. Mortgage availability is minimal; banks require collateral that most Malawians cannot provide. Construction is sporadic, self-driven, and concentrated in informal areas. Zoning regulations exist but lack enforcement capacity. Cities sprawl chaotically around edges without planning. Density is variable: dense informal compounds in central areas, lower-density sprawl peripherally. Transit doesn't exist; transportation is by foot or informal taxis. Real estate speculation is modest because property rights are insecure. Homelessness is significant: thousands of street children and families in temporary shelters, particularly in Blantyre. Rental markets are entirely informal with minimal protections; disputes are resolved informally or ignored. What Malawi needs urgently is supply-side expansion: land titling programs, simplified development approval processes, and investment in basic infrastructure. Without these, housing affordability will continue deteriorating as urbanization accelerates. The humanitarian stakes are high: housing insecurity correlates with malnutrition, disease, and educational failure.`,

  'South Sudan': {
    summary: `South Sudan's housing sector barely functions; the country is in active conflict and humanitarian crisis. Juba and other urban centers have collapsed housing markets; perhaps 2-5% of the population lives in formalized, titled housing. The overwhelming majority occupies informal shelters, makeshift structures, and temporary arrangements. Affordability is irrelevant when supply is so constrained that housing availability itself is the issue. Homeownership is minimal and often contingent on political connections or military affiliation. Mortgages don't exist. Construction is minimal and sporadic, driven by humanitarian organizations and government buildings rather than residential markets. Zoning doesn't function; cities sprawl chaotically and often become temporary displacement camps. Density is highly variable—dense informal compounds where they exist, but many areas are simply encampments. Transit doesn't exist. Real estate speculation is minimal; property rights are completely insecure. Homelessness is massive: millions are internally displaced, in refugee camps, or in urban informal settlements. Rental markets function informally, and rental costs are often impossible to pay; many people are in debt-servitude arrangements. The fundamental issue is that South Sudan lacks state capacity for institutional development. Until conflict stabilizes and governance improves, housing will remain a humanitarian crisis. International aid and refugee programs are currently the only sources of housing for the displaced.`,

  'Eritrea': {
    summary: `Eritrea's housing market is heavily controlled by the authoritarian state, which functions as the primary housing provider and land controller. Asmara has been urbanized for decades, but the government maintains tight control over all real estate transactions. Formal housing is allocated through state programs; private ownership exists but only by government permission. Homeownership rates are artificially constrained by state policy; the government restricts private property to maintain political control. Construction activity is state-directed; the government builds housing for officials, military, and selected populations. Private construction is minimal and requires permits that are difficult to obtain. Zoning is entirely state-controlled with minimal transparency. Cities develop according to government plans rather than market signals. Density is regulated by state direction. Transit-oriented development is nonexistent; transportation is limited. Real estate speculation doesn't exist in a meaningful sense because the state forbids it. Homelessness is minimal in visible terms, but housing quality is poor and availability is restricted. Rental markets are state-controlled; government allocates housing to workers and soldiers. The system reduces housing to an instrument of political control rather than an economic good. What might appear as stability—visible homelessness is low—actually masks profound rights restrictions and housing deprivation. Market liberalization could improve housing quality and availability, but would require the state to surrender control.`,

  'Djibouti': {
    summary: `Djibouti's housing market is highly constrained by geography and limited economic base, though the government and military provide some housing. Djibouti City is extremely hot and geographically confined, limiting sprawl and making land scarce. Formal housing exists but is heavily concentrated among government employees and military personnel. Homeownership rates are low; perhaps 20-25% of the population lives in owner-occupied formal housing. Affordability is very poor; housing costs consume 40-50% of household incomes for formal-sector workers. Construction activity is modest but present: some government housing programs and private development occur. Zoning is minimal; the city develops somewhat chaotically given geographic constraints. Density is necessarily high in habitable zones, with surrounding areas sparsely populated due to climate. Transit-oriented development doesn't meaningfully exist. Real estate speculation is minimal; property rights are secure but availability is the constraining factor. Homelessness exists: street children and families in informal structures number in the thousands. Rental markets function informally with minimal tenant protections; rents are high relative to incomes. Djibouti's fundamental constraint is geography—the country is small, hot, and geographically limited. Housing policy cannot overcome these natural constraints, but can improve conditions through land use liberalization and affordable housing construction. Without deliberate effort, housing insecurity will deepen.`,

  'Sierra Leone': {
    summary: `Sierra Leone's housing sector is recovering from war and civil conflict that devastated infrastructure. Freetown and other urban centers have expanded rapidly since the war's end in 2002, but housing construction has lagged demand. Formal housing constitutes perhaps 10-15% of urban stock; the remainder is informal and often inadequate. Affordability is poor: formal rents consume 45-55% of household incomes, forcing most into informal settlements. Homeownership among the poor is technically common—self-building occurs—but without legal security. Mortgages are unavailable; banks won't lend without collateral documentation. Construction is sporadic and driven by individual effort rather than organized development. Zoning regulations exist but lack enforcement. Cities sprawl chaotically without comprehensive planning. Density varies from dense central compounds to sprawling peripheral areas. Transit doesn't exist; transportation is by foot or informal taxis. Real estate speculation is emerging as wealthy traders and foreign investors increasingly purchase property. Homelessness is significant: street children and families in temporary structures are visible. Rental markets are entirely informal with zero tenant protections. Post-war recovery is incomplete; housing remains one of the major development challenges. What Sierra Leone needs is investment in formal development, land administration, and housing finance. Without it, recovery will remain incomplete and housing insecurity will persist.`,

  'Liberia': {
    summary: `Liberia's housing sector, like much of the country, is recovering from devastating civil conflict. Monrovia's population has grown since peace was established in 2003, but housing construction has not kept pace. Formal housing is minimal—perhaps 5-10% of urban housing has documented titles and standard construction. The vast majority lives in informal structures ranging from concrete block to corrugated metal and wood. Affordability is critical: formal rents consume 50-60% of household incomes, forcing lower-income residents into extreme overcrowding. Homeownership is primarily among those wealthy enough to self-build on claimed land; mortgage availability is virtually nonexistent. Construction is sporadic and entirely informal; organized development is minimal. Zoning doesn't function meaningfully; Monrovia sprawls chaotically. Density is highly variable—dense informal compounds in central areas, chaotic sprawl peripherally. Transit doesn't exist; transportation is by foot or informal minibuses. Real estate speculation is emerging as investors recognize potential. Homelessness is significant: street children and families living in temporary structures are visible throughout Monrovia. Rental markets function entirely informally with rents paid daily or weekly with zero security. Liberia's housing situation reflects broader institutional weakness.

  'Ivory Coast': {
    summary: `Ivory Coast's real estate market is recovering from political crisis and has become one of the more active in West Africa, but affordability remains strained. Abidjan and other urban centers have seen sustained development and investment over the past decade. Formal housing constitutes perhaps 30-40% of urban stock, higher than comparable countries. Homeownership is accessible for the middle class; mortgage availability from banks has improved. Housing affordability, while not yet critical, has deteriorated as prices have appreciated; formal rents consume 35-45% of household incomes in developed neighborhoods. Construction activity is robust: private developers build continuously, driven by strong demand and capital availability. Zoning regulations are enforced reasonably well, producing relatively organized city development. Transit-oriented development is emerging: some neighborhood planning envisions central commercial clusters. Density varies from high-rise development in central Abidjan to lower-density sprawl in peripheral areas. Real estate speculation is significant and increasing: investors from across West Africa purchase property for appreciation, helping finance new construction but also driving prices. Homelessness is less visible than in poorer countries but informal settlements remain substantial. Rental markets are increasingly formal with written agreements becoming standard in middle-class areas. The concern is inequality: Ivory Coast's development boom has benefited the educated middle class but left lower-income workers increasingly priced out. Without deliberate affordable housing policy, inequality will deepen. What's working is investor confidence and development activity.

Rental markets are informal with zero tenant protections. What Benin needs is a comprehensive approach: land titling, credit systems, organized development, and affordable housing policies. Without these, housing insecurity will deepen as population continues urbanizing.`,

  'Gambia': {
    summary: `Gambia's housing sector is constrained by small population and limited economic capacity, but market development has occurred. Banjul and other towns have seen moderate growth, with some formal housing development. Formal housing constitutes perhaps 20-30% of urban stock; informal housing remains significant. Affordability is moderate: formal rents consume 30-40% of household incomes, though this varies widely by neighborhood. Homeownership is accessible for a portion of the middle class; mortgage availability is limited but present. Construction activity is moderate: some private development occurs alongside government housing programs. Zoning is enforced reasonably well. Transit-oriented development is minimal. Density is relatively low; Gambia's size enables spreading development. Real estate speculation is present but modest; property rights are reasonably secure. Homelessness is less visible than in larger neighbors but informal settlements remain substantial. Rental markets are increasingly formal with written agreements becoming common. Gambia's advantage is reasonable governance and secure property rights. What's needed is increased housing supply through liberalized development and directed investment in affordable stock. With modest policy improvements, housing outcomes could improve significantly.`,

  'Mauritania': {
    summary: `Mauritania's housing sector reflects climate stress, poverty, and migration creating difficult conditions. Nouakchott has expanded rapidly from a small city in 1980 to over 1 million people today, creating severe housing shortages. Formal housing is minimal—perhaps 5-10% of the population lives in standard titled housing. The vast majority occupies informal structures that range from concrete block to makeshift shelters. Affordability is critical: formal rents consume 50-60% of household incomes, forcing people into severe overcrowding. Homeownership among the poor is technically common—families self-build on claimed land—but without legal security. Mortgages don't exist. Construction is entirely self-driven and informal; organized development is minimal. Zoning doesn't function meaningfully; Nouakchott sprawls chaotically. Density is extremely high in central areas where space is scarce, lower in sprawling peripheries. Transit doesn't exist; transportation is by foot or informal taxis. Real estate speculation is minimal because property rights are too insecure. Homelessness is significant: displaced persons from drought and conflict, street children, and families in temporary structures number in the hundreds of thousands. Rental markets function informally with minimal protections. Mauritania faces climate and environmental challenges that intensify housing pressure. What's needed is land administration, affordable housing construction, and climate adaptation support. Without these, housing will remain a crisis.`,

  'Congo-Brazzaville': {
    summary: `Congo-Brazzaville's housing sector reflects oil dependency, rapid urbanization, and inequality in ways that create a divided market. Brazzaville has expanded significantly, with housing markets developing unequally by neighborhood. Formal housing constitutes perhaps 25-35% of urban stock, higher than many neighbors but still inadequate. Homeownership is accessible for the wealthy and middle class through a functioning credit system, but remains out of reach for workers. Affordability is problematic: formal rents consume 35-45% of household incomes, with poor neighborhoods often experiencing much worse ratios. Construction activity is present, driven by government housing programs and private investor interest in resource-wealth driven growth. Zoning is enforced reasonably well, producing organized development in some areas while informal sprawl dominates peripheries. Transit-oriented development is minimal; transportation is car-dependent or informal taxis. Density varies: high-rise development in wealthy enclaves, dense informal compounds in poorer areas, sprawling peripheries. Real estate speculation is increasing as investors recognize growth potential. Homelessness is visible: informal settlements remain substantial, with street populations visible. Rental markets vary by neighborhood: formalized with written agreements in middle-class areas, entirely informal in lower-income zones. The concern is that oil wealth has not translated into housing security for ordinary workers. What's needed is deliberate affordable housing policy and land tenure security for informal residents. Without these, growth will deepen inequality.`,

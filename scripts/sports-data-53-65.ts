    summary: `Let's talk about Greek football's Nations League campaign, because they just pulled off one of the most shocking results of 2024—beat England 2-1 at Wembley in October, then followed it up by promoting to League A after beating Scotland 3-0 in the playoff second leg (March 2025). That Wembley win was massive. Greece under Ivan Jovanović finished second in League B Group B2 behind only England on goal difference, beating Finland 3-0 and 2-0, Ireland twice (2-0 away and home), before that England loss at home (0-3, Curtis Jones scoring on his debut). The promotion playoff drama was real—they lost the first leg 0-1 to Scotland at home, which looked disastrous, then traveled to Glasgow and dominated 3-0. That's League A football next cycle, competing with Europe's elite.

Basketball's where Greece made real waves at Paris 2024. Giannis Antetokounmpo played his first Olympics after Greece qualified for the first time since 2008 by winning the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Piraeus, beating Croatia 80-69 in front of a home crowd. Giannis was MVP of the qualifying tournament—22.7 points per game on 62.5 percent shooting, including 50 percent from three. That's absurd efficiency. At the Olympics, they lost to Canada in the opener, then beat Australia 77-71 to give themselves a shot, but couldn't advance from the group. Still, getting Giannis to the Olympics and showing they can compete is huge for Greek basketball's future. The domestic Greek Super League remains strong, producing talent that feeds into European competitions.

Euro 2024 qualifying was disappointing—Greece failed to qualify despite the Nations League success giving them a safety net. But that's the contradiction of Greek football: they can beat England at Wembley and promote through the playoffs, yet couldn't navigate a standard qualifying group. The inconsistency is maddening if you're a Greek fan. Jovanović's clearly got them organized and playing with confidence in tournament football, but the broader structural issues—domestic league quality, youth development, tactical flexibility—need addressing if they want to be more than occasional giant-killers. The Scotland comeback showed mental fortitude; now they need to translate that into consistent qualifying performances. With League A football coming, they'll face tougher opponents regularly, which should either expose the gaps or accelerate their development.`,

    summary: `Here's what you need to know about Guatemalan sports right now—they just made Olympic history at Paris 2024, and it changes everything. Adriana Ruano Oliva won Guatemala's first-ever Olympic gold medal in women's trap shooting, setting a new Olympic record with 45 out of 50 targets in the final on August 7. That's not just Guatemala's first gold; it's their third Olympic medal total after two silvers back in the 1950s. Jean Pierre Brol added a bronze in men's trap shooting, meaning Guatemala left Paris with two shooting medals from a 16-athlete delegation (six women, 10 men). The IOC had suspended Guatemala for two years over Olympic Committee governance issues, and they provisionally lifted that suspension just in time for Paris. Imagine the pressure—return to the Olympics after all that controversy and immediately deliver your nation's greatest sporting achievement ever.

Football's World Cup 2026 qualifying campaign has been a grind. Guatemala handled the Second Round easily enough—beat Dominica 6-0, the British Virgin Islands 3-0, and the Dominican Republic 4-2 to advance. But the Third Round (Final Round) is exposing the gap between CONCACAF's mid-tier and top nations. They're in Group A, lost 1-0 to El Salvador at home, and while the campaign's ongoing, Guatemala's facing the reality that reaching the 2026 World Cup (co-hosted in North America) is a massive uphill battle. The Liga Nacional—Guatemala's domestic league—is improving structurally, getting more organized and professional, but it's not producing players capable of competing consistently with Mexico, the United States, Costa Rica, or even Panama and Honduras. The talent pipeline exists, but development stops at a level that's fine for regional success, not World Cup qualification.

The Olympic shooting success should be a blueprint: invest in sports where technical excellence and individual coaching can overcome resource disadvantages. Guatemala's got a population of 18 million, but the football federation doesn't have the infrastructure or funding to compete with richer nations in a squad sport requiring 23 top-level players. Shooting requires elite facilities, expert coaches, and dedicated athletes—Guatemala clearly has that system working. Whether this translates to sustained Olympic success or broader sports development depends on how the government and sports federations respond. For now, Ruano Oliva's gold is a moment of national pride that transcends sports, proving Guatemalan athletes can compete at the absolute highest level when given proper support.`,

    summary: `Let's talk about Guyanese cricket, because while they're not playing international matches, they're absolutely dominating the West Indies regional circuit and the Caribbean Premier League. The Guyana Amazon Warriors are the defending CPL champions after winning their first title in 2023, and the 2024 season (August 29-October 6) saw them competing at Guyana National Stadium in Providence with massive crowds—the match against Trinbago Knight Riders sold 19,967 tickets, which is serious attendance for T20 franchise cricket. The final was held at Providence, showcasing Guyana as a cricket destination. Meanwhile, the Guyana national team plays in the Regional Four Day Competition and Super50 Cup, not international cricket, but they're competitive. January 2025, they beat Barbados by 10 wickets in the West Indies Championship. November 2024, they beat the Windward Islands by 2 wickets in the Super50 Cup before losing to Trinidad & Tobago by 45 runs. That's the contradiction of Guyanese cricket—elite domestic success, historic CPL venue, but no pathway to international recognition outside the West Indies structure.

Football's basically non-existent at the highest level. Guyana doesn't participate in Copa América—CONMEBOL excludes Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana from their tournament despite being South American nations geographically. They're a CONCACAF member instead, competing in Gold Cup and World Cup qualifying when they can field competitive teams, which isn't often. There's no real domestic league infrastructure producing professional players, no youth academies feeding into international clubs, and minimal government investment in football development. Cricket gets the attention, the crowds, the infrastructure, while football languishes.

At Paris 2024, Guyana sent a small Olympic delegation focused on athletics, and predictably, no medals. That's the reality for Caribbean nations without oil wealth or major international corporate sponsors—Olympic sports require sustained funding, coaching pipelines, and facilities that Guyana can't afford to build across multiple disciplines. Cricket works because it's culturally embedded, regionally organized through Cricket West Indies, and commercially viable through CPL and international tours. Everything else struggles. The Amazon Warriors' success shows what's possible with proper investment and organization—a professional franchise model with international stars playing in world-class facilities. If Guyana could replicate that model in football or athletics, maybe they'd have broader sporting success. Until then, cricket's the whole game.`,

    summary: `Here's the brutal reality of Haitian football right now—they're stuck in third place in World Cup 2026 qualifying Group C with 5 points, coming off a 3-0 thrashing by Honduras in October 2025 after beating Nicaragua 3-0 earlier that month. September saw draws with Honduras (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-3), which looked promising until the wheels came off against Honduras on October 13. Rigoberto Rivas, Anthony Lozano, and Rommel Quioto scored inside 40 minutes, and Haiti had no response. The Nicaragua win (goals from Duckens Nazon, Danley Jean-Jacques, Don Deedson Louicius) kept them alive mathematically, but Honduras and Costa Rica are pulling away in Group C. The top team qualifies directly for 2026, with the second-place finisher heading to playoffs. Haiti's realistically fighting for scraps now. They missed Copa América 2024 after losing the play-in to Costa Rica, so there's no recent tournament experience to build confidence or cohesion.

At Paris 2024, Haiti sent 8 athletes across athletics, boxing, gymnastics, judo, and swimming—their 18th Olympic appearance since debuting in 1900. Every single athlete was eliminated in the first round. Lynnzee Brown became Haiti's first Olympic gymnast, which is historic from a participation standpoint, but didn't translate to results. Philippe Metellus was the flag bearer, a 34-year-old judoka fresh off a silver medal at the Abidjan African Open, yet he couldn't advance. Alexandre Grand'Pierre (swimmer), Cedrick Belony-Dulièpre (boxer), and 14-year-old Mayah Chouloute (the youngest Haitian Olympian) all competed, all went home without medals. Haiti's total Olympic medal count remains two—both won in the 1920s. That's a century without a podium finish.

The infrastructure simply doesn't exist. Haiti's dealing with political instability, economic crisis, and natural disasters that make sustained sports investment impossible. Football's popular because it's cheap—you need a ball and space—but developing elite players requires academies, coaching, international exposure, and professional leagues. Haiti has none of that functioning reliably. The World Cup qualifying campaign exposes the gap: they can compete in one-off matches when everything clicks, but over a six-game group with preparation, tactics, and squad depth mattering, they fall short. Unless there's massive external investment or a fundamental restructuring of Haitian sports governance, this cycle repeats: brief hope, harsh reality, another generation of talent wasted.`,

    summary: `Let's talk about Honduras and World Cup 2026 qualifying, because they're sitting top of CONCACAF Group C right now and looking like the real deal. After cruising through the Second Round with victories over Nicaragua and staying unbeaten on the road (3 wins, 1 draw), they've carried that momentum into the Third Round. The October 2025 beatdown of Haiti—3-0 with goals from Rigoberto Rivas (18'), Anthony Lozano (28'), and Rommel Quioto (40')—was clinical. Three goals in 22 minutes, game over by halftime. They'd drawn 0-0 with Haiti in September, so this was a statement: we're better than you, and we're proving it when it matters. With matches against Nicaragua (November 13) and Costa Rica (November 18, 2025) coming up, Honduras controls their destiny. Top of Group C means automatic World Cup qualification—no playoffs, no drama, straight to 2026.

But let's not pretend everything's perfect. Honduras failed to qualify for Copa América 2024, losing the play-in to Costa Rica 3-1 on March 23, 2024, after Costa Rica also beat them on penalties in Nations League. That's two chances to make a major tournament, two failures. The Copa América miss particularly stings because it was a chance to test themselves against CONMEBOL opposition and build experience ahead of World Cup qualifying. Instead, they're going into 2026 (if they qualify) without recent tournament reps against elite competition. The domestic Liga Nacional is improving structurally—more organization, better facilities, attempting to professionalize—but it's not producing players good enough to dominate CONCACAF yet. Honduras relies on their diaspora playing abroad and a handful of domestic stars.

At Paris 2024, Honduras sent 4 athletes (1 woman, 3 men) and came home empty-handed. They've appeared at every Summer Games since 1968 except Munich 1972 and Moscow 1980 (boycott), but Olympic success has never been Honduras's strength. Football's what matters, and right now, they're in the driver's seat for World Cup 2026. The pressure's mounting though—Honduras hasn't reached a World Cup since 2014, and missing 2018 and 2022 hurt their development and international profile. This is their chance to re-establish themselves as a CONCACAF force. Beat Nicaragua and Costa Rica, secure that automatic spot, and suddenly Honduran football's relevant again. Slip up, and it's another cycle of what-ifs and wasted potential.`,

    summary: `Here's the thing about Hungarian sports—they absolutely crushed it at Paris 2024 with 19 medals (6 gold, 7 silver, 6 bronze), finishing 14th in the global medal table, but their football's in complete freefall. Let's start with the Olympics because that's where Hungary proved they're still an elite sporting nation. Swimming delivered five medals: Hubert Kós won gold in the 200m backstroke (1:54.26), Kristóf Milák took gold in the 100m butterfly (49.90) and silver in the 200m fly, becoming only the second male swimmer after Michael Phelps to win four Olympic butterfly medals. Open water added Kristóf Rasovszky's 10km gold and Dávid Betlehem's bronze. That's world-class depth. Water polo saw both teams fall short—the men lost the bronze medal match to USA 11-8 in a shootout, and the women lost their quarterfinal to USA 5-4. Still, competing for medals in water polo is expected when you're Hungary.

Football, though? Absolute disaster. Euro 2024 Group A: lost 3-1 to Switzerland, 0-2 to Germany, then beat Scotland 1-0 with Kevin Csoboth's 100th-minute winner—which looked heroic until you realize it still meant third place and elimination. Nations League 2024-25 was worse. Hungary competed in League A Group 3 (their first time in the top tier) and got exposed: lost 5-0 to Germany, drew 0-0 with Bosnia, drew 1-1 with Netherlands, beat Bosnia 2-0, lost 4-0 to Netherlands, drew 1-1 with Germany. Finished with 6 points and a minus-7 goal difference. Then came the relegation playoffs against Turkey, and it was brutal—lost 3-1 away, 0-3 at home, aggregate 1-6. They're back down to League B, and coach Marco Rossi's under serious pressure.

The contrast couldn't be starker. Hungarian swimming has infrastructure, coaching excellence, and a century of tradition producing Olympic champions. Water polo's embedded in the culture—Hungary's won nine Olympic gold medals in men's water polo, more than any nation. Football? The domestic league doesn't produce talent capable of competing in Europe's top five leagues, the youth development system's broken, and they're stuck between mid-tier European nations without the resources or vision to climb higher. Rossi got them to Euro 2024, which was progress, but getting relegated from Nations League A after one cycle shows they weren't ready for that level. Hungary's an Olympic powerhouse that can't figure out football, and in Europe, that's a problem.`,

    summary: `Let's talk about Icelandic football's complete collapse, because they've gone from Euro 2016 quarter-finalists to Nations League C in less than a decade. Euro 2024 qualifying was already disappointing—finished 4th in their group with 3 wins, 1 draw, 6 losses—but they got a lifeline through Nations League playoffs. Beat Israel 4-1 with an Albert Guðmundsson hat-trick in the semi-final, which looked promising, then lost 2-1 to Ukraine in the final after leading at halftime. That hurt, but the real disaster was Nations League 2024-25 in League B Group 4. Started okay: beat Montenegro 2-0, then lost 3-1 to Turkey, drew 2-2 with Wales, lost 4-2 to Turkey, got hammered 4-1 by Wales away, beat Montenegro 2-0 again. Finished third, which sent them to relegation playoffs against Kosovo. Lost 2-1 away, 1-3 at home, aggregate 2-5. Iceland's now in League C—the third tier—after competing in League A for the first two Nations League cycles. That's a catastrophic decline.

The 2016 Euro run feels like ancient history now. That team had Gylfi Sigurðsson, Aron Gunnarsson, and Ragnar Sigurðsson leading a squad built on organization, set pieces, and belief. They knocked out England in the Round of 16 and pushed France in the quarters. Since then? Failed to qualify for 2018 World Cup, missed Euro 2020, missed 2022 World Cup, missed Euro 2024. The generation that made Iceland relevant has aged out, and there's no replacement talent coming through. The domestic Úrvalsdeild produces players for Nordic leagues, not Europe's elite competitions. Guðmundsson's the exception—playing in Serie A for Genoa—but one star can't carry a national team through qualifying.

At Paris 2024, Iceland sent 5 athletes (3 women, 2 men) in athletics, shooting, swimming, and triathlon. Zero medals. Historically, Iceland's won four Olympic medals: silver in triple jump (1956), bronze in judo (1984), bronze in women's pole vault (2000), and silver in men's handball (2008). That handball silver was the peak—an entire team sport reaching an Olympic final. But they didn't even qualify a handball team for Paris, which tells you how far the sporting infrastructure's declined. With a population of 370,000, Iceland punched massively above their weight for a decade. Now they're regressing to the mean, and without serious investment in youth development and coaching, League C football is their new reality.`,

    summary: `Let's talk about Indian cricket in 2024-2025, because they just won BOTH the T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy but somehow missed the World Test Championship final for the first time. That's the paradox of modern Indian cricket. June 29, 2024: beat South Africa in the T20 World Cup final, becoming the third team (after England and West Indies) to win the tournament twice and the first to go undefeated. Arshdeep Singh took 17 wickets (joint-highest), Jasprit Bumrah was player of the tournament. March 9, 2025: won the Champions Trophy undefeated. In ODIs, they swept South Africa 3-0 and West Indies 3-0 at home, beat New Zealand 2-1, though they lost 3-0 to Australia away. That's white-ball dominance.

Test cricket's where it fell apart. After beating England and Bangladesh, India lost 3-0 to New Zealand at HOME—an absolute shock result that exposed their spin-friendly pitch strategy backfiring. Then they failed to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia (no hat-trick), which meant they missed the 2025 World Test Championship final despite being in a comfortable qualifying position before those two series. Drew the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2 with England (2025), beat West Indies 2-0 at home. ICC Rankings as of May 2025: 9th in Tests, 9th in ODIs, 10th in T20Is. Those rankings are absurd for a team that just won two global white-ball tournaments. The split between formats is massive—India's figured out how to dominate limited-overs cricket but can't maintain Test excellence anymore.

Paris 2024 Olympics was a mixed bag: 6 medals (1 silver, 5 bronze), ranked 71st overall. Manu Bhaker made history with two shooting bronzes—first Indian woman to win an Olympic shooting medal and first Indian since independence to win two medals at one Games. Sarabjot Singh added mixed pistol bronze, Swapnil Kusale took 50m rifle bronze (India's first three medals in one sport). Hockey bronze against Spain marked back-to-back Olympic medals for the first time since 1972. Neeraj Chopra's silver in javelin (defending his Tokyo gold) made him the fifth Indian multiple Olympic medalist. Aman Sehrawat became the youngest Indian Olympic medalist at 21 with wrestling 57kg bronze. The shooting and hockey infrastructure's working—three medals in shooting shows depth. But ranked 71st with six medals from a nation of 1.4 billion? That's a systemic failure in Olympic sports development. Cricket's the whole game in India, and everything else starves for attention and funding.`,

    summary: `Here's what you need to know about Indonesian sports right now—they just made Olympic history at Paris 2024 by winning their first-ever gold medals outside badminton, and it's a massive moment for a nation that's been defined by shuttlecock dominance for decades. August 8: Veddriq Leonardo won gold in speed sport climbing with a 4.75-second ascent. August 9: Rizki Juniansyah won gold in weightlifting 73kg with 155kg in the snatch and 199kg in the clean and jerk (Olympic record). Both are Indonesia's first golds in original Summer Olympic sports—not badminton, which only joined the Olympics in 1992. That's 32 years of waiting for this diversification. Gregoria Mariska Tunjung won bronze in badminton women's singles, becoming the first Indonesian woman to medal in singles since 2008, but Indonesia failed to win badminton gold for only the second time since 1992 (the other being 2012). That's a seismic shift in Indonesian Olympic identity.

Badminton's still king, though. February 16, 2025: Indonesia won the Badminton Asia Mixed Team Championships for the first time, beating China 3-1 on Chinese soil. That's a statement result. Sudirman Cup 2025: seeded second, won Group D, beat India 4-1, advanced to quarterfinals. Indonesia Open 2025 is ongoing. The depth of Indonesian badminton talent remains world-class—they're producing players who can compete with China, Japan, and Denmark consistently. But Paris showed the federation's strategic investment in other sports is finally paying off. Speed climbing and weightlifting require different infrastructure (climbing walls, weightlifting facilities, specialized coaching), and Indonesia built those systems specifically to diversify their Olympic medal count.

Football's a disaster. World Cup qualifying's seen shock losses to China and Bahrain, and Indonesia's stuck in AFC qualifying knowing they're miles behind Japan, South Korea, Australia, and even Saudi Arabia. The domestic Liga 1 is improving in attendance and commercial appeal, but it's not producing players good enough for European leagues or even consistent AFC Champions League runs. Badminton gets government funding, corporate sponsorship, and national pride. Football gets passion without infrastructure. The Paris golds prove Indonesia can build elite sports programs when they commit resources and expertise. Now the question is whether they'll replicate that model for football and other team sports, or stick with individual Olympic events where success is more predictable.`,

    summary: `Let's talk about Iran and the 2026 World Cup, because they QUALIFIED on March 25, 2025, after a 2-2 draw with Uzbekistan—Mehdi Taremi scored twice to secure their seventh World Cup appearance. This is Iranian football doing what it does: grinding through Asian qualifying with just enough quality and organization to get over the line. October 2024 was when they made their statement: beat Qatar 4-1 in Dubai, with Sardar Azmoun and Mohammad Mohebi each scoring twice. That result put Iran top of Group A with 10 points, ahead of Uzbekistan on goal difference. They've been to six World Cups already, never made it past the group stage, but this qualification cycle they've looked more ruthless. Lost the 2023 Asian Cup semi-final to hosts Qatar, which stings, but the focus was always on World Cup 2026, and they delivered.

At Paris 2024, Iran won 12 medals (3 gold, 6 silver, 3 bronze), finishing 21st overall, and every single medal came from wrestling and taekwondo. Greco-Roman wrestling: golds for Saeed Esmaeili (67kg) and Mohammad-Hadi Saravi (97kg), silver for Alireza Mohmadi (87kg), bronze for Amin Mirzazadeh (130kg). Freestyle wrestling: silvers for Hassan Yazdani (86kg), Amir-Hossein Zare (125kg), and Rahman Amouzad (65kg), plus bronze for Amir-Ali Azarpira (97kg). That's eight wrestling medals from a nation with deep institutional knowledge in the sport. Taekwondo delivered four historic medals: Arian Salimi won gold in +80kg (Iran's first taekwondo gold in 16 years), Mehran Barkhordari took silver in 80kg, Nahid Kiani became the first Iranian female taekwondo athlete to win Olympic silver (57kg), and Mobina Nematzadeh grabbed bronze in 49kg.

The four-member taekwondo team bringing home four medals is absurd efficiency—100 percent medal rate. That's what happens when you identify sports where your cultural strengths (combat disciplines, mental toughness, technical precision) align with Olympic medal opportunities, then invest heavily in coaching and facilities. Iranian wrestling and taekwondo federations are world-class operations. Football gets the attention and passion, but these Olympic sports get results. Iran's heading to World Cup 2026 with momentum, a qualified squad, and realistic hopes of finally advancing from the group stage for the first time. Meanwhile, wrestling and taekwondo keep adding to Iran's Olympic legacy—those 12 Paris medals took Iran's total to over 70 in Olympic history, mostly from these combat sports.`,

Graham Arnold came in—the former Australia coach who led the Socceroos to the Round of 16 at 2022 World Cup. Finished third in the group, advanced to the Fourth Round.

Fourth Round's been a rollercoaster. Zidane Iqbal scored a 76th-minute goal to beat Indonesia, keeping hopes alive. Then came the Saudi Arabia match in Jeddah: 0-0 draw, which mathematically eliminated Iraq from automatic qualification. They're now in the global playoffs—intercontinental matches against teams from other confederations, winner-takes-all for a World Cup spot. That's not where Iraq wanted to be. They've got the talent—Iqbal (on loan from Manchester United), experienced players in Europe and the Gulf leagues—but the coaching instability and tactical inconsistency have been brutal. Arnold's job is getting them through the playoffs, but the margin for error is gone.

At Paris 2024, Iraq sent their U-23 football team and finished with 1 win, 2 losses in Group B. Beat Ukraine 2-1 (which looked great), then lost 3-1 to Argentina (expected) and 0-3 to Morocco (disappointing). Three points, didn't advance. Morocco and Argentina went through. Iraq qualified for the Olympics by finishing third at the 2024 AFC U-23 Asian Cup, but the group stage exit shows the gap between qualifying and competing. The Gulf Cup win proves Iraq can raise their game for regional tournaments—home crowd, motivated players, tactical preparation. But over a long World Cup qualifying cycle requiring consistency across multiple matches and conditions, they've stumbled repeatedly. The global playoffs are a last chance to save the campaign, and if they miss out, it's another cycle of wasted potential and what-ifs for Iraqi football.`,

    summary: `Let's talk about Ireland at Paris 2024, because they just had their best Olympics EVER—10 medals (4 gold, 3 silver, 3 bronze), smashing the previous record of 6 from London 2012. This was seven years of planning, investment, and elite athlete development paying off spectacularly. Start with rowing: Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy defended their Tokyo 2020 lightweight double sculls gold, cementing their status as Ireland's greatest Olympic partnership. Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch won bronze in men's heavyweight pairs—Ireland's first-ever heavyweight rowing medal, breaking their lightweight-only tradition. The women's four (Aifric Keogh, Eimear Lambe, Fiona Murtagh, Emily Hegarty) took bronze. That's three rowing medals from a nation that's built world-class training facilities and coaching programs over the past decade.

Boxing delivered as always. Kellie Harrington successfully defended her Tokyo lightweight title, joining Katie Taylor in the pantheon of Irish Olympic boxing legends. Aidan Walsh took bronze in welterweight. Daniel Wiffen won gold in swimming, Mona McSharry bronze. Rhys McClenaghan—who fell off the pommel horse in Tokyo, devastated—came back and won gold in Paris with a brilliant routine. That's mental fortitude. Rhasidat Adeleke finished fourth in the 400m final (49.28 seconds), becoming the first Irish woman to contest an Olympic sprint final. No medal, but a historic performance that shows Irish athletics is rising. Rugby's where Irish sporting success traditionally lives, though—Six Nations 2024, won the title for the second successive year, beating Scotland 17-13 on the final day. Six Nations 2025: beat England 27-22, Scotland 32-18, Wales 27-18, lost to France 27-42, beat Italy 22-17. Autumn Nations 2024: beat Australia 22-19. Summer 2025: demolished Georgia 34-5 and Portugal 106-7.

Football's the one failure. Nations League 2024-25: lost to Greece twice (0-2 away and home), drew with England, finished third in League B Group B2. Greece beat them convincingly both times, which is frustrating when you see the Olympic success and rugby dominance. Irish football development hasn't kept pace with other Irish sports—the FAI's been plagued by financial issues and governance problems, while rugby and Olympic sports have had sustained investment and professional structures. Paris 2024 proved Ireland can compete at the absolute highest level in Olympic sports when the systems are built correctly. Now they need to figure out how to replicate that model for football, because the talent pool exists—it just needs proper development pathways.`,

    summary: `Here's the thing about Israeli sports right now—they just had their best Olympics ever at Paris 2024 with 7 medals (1 gold, 5 silver, 1 bronze), but their football's been relegated from Nations League A after a brutal first exposure to Europe's elite. Let's start with the Olympics because that's the success story. Judo delivered three medals: Raz Hershko took silver in women's +78kg, Inbar Lanir silver in 78kg, and Peter Paltchik (the flag bearer) bronze in 100kg. That brings Israel's total Olympic judo medals to 9 out of their 20 all-time medals—judo's basically Israel's Olympic identity, built on decades of investment in coaching, training facilities, and identifying talented kids early. The Israeli Judo Association is one of the most professional sports federations in the country.

Gymnastics added two medals: Artem Dolgopyat won silver in floor exercise, becoming the first Israeli athlete to medal at consecutive Olympics. The rhythmic gymnastics team (Romi Paritzki, Ofir Shaham, Diana Svertsov, Adar Friedmann, Shani Bakanov) won silver in the all-around team competition. Add two sailing medals, and that's seven total—doubling their previous best. This was years of Olympic preparation, sports science, and strategic focus on disciplines where Israel could realistically compete for medals. The Israeli Olympic Committee identified judo, gymnastics, and sailing as priority sports, funded them heavily, and got results.

Football's another story entirely. Euro 2024 qualifying: beat Belarus 2-1, got hammered 4-1 by Iceland (Albert Guðmundsson hat-trick), didn't qualify. Israel's "home" matches were played in Hungary due to security concerns, which affects preparation and fan support. Nations League 2024-25 League A Group 2—Israel's first time in the top tier—was brutal. Lost 3-1 to Belgium, 2-1 to Italy, 4-1 to France, 4-1 to Italy again. Drew 0-0 with France, beat Belgium 1-0 on the final matchday. Finished fourth, relegated back to League B. That's the reality: Israel's football is good enough for League B, occasionally competitive in League A, but not sustainable at that level yet. The domestic Israeli Premier League doesn't produce enough quality to fill out a squad capable of competing with France, Italy, and Belgium consistently. Olympic sports have figured out the formula for success—now Israeli football needs that same strategic investment and development to catch up.`,

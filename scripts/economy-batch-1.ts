    summary: `# Argentina - Economy & Business

So here's a thing about Argentina: They've defaulted on their sovereign debt nine times (nine!), inflation hit 211% in 2023, and the peso is basically a collectible currency at this point—and yet Javier Milei, a guy who campaigns with a chainsaw and wants to dollarize the economy, is somehow stabilizing things. (I guess when you've tried everything else, "elect the anarcho-capitalist who wants to abolish the central bank" starts looking reasonable.) In November 2025, something genuinely weird is happening: monthly inflation dropped to 2.7%, the lowest since 2020, the peso is actually strengthening, and the IMF just approved another $20 billion for Milei's shock therapy program. Markets are treating Argentina like it's a frontier tech stock—hugely risky but with asymmetric upside. The Trump administration just announced a $40 billion support package (yes, really), which tells you this isn't just about economics anymore; it's about the U.S. backing a libertarian experiment in its own backyard. Obviously this could all implode spectacularly, but for now, Milei is the bond vigilante's favorite crazy person.

## The Big Issue 1: Dollarization (Or: How to Destroy Your Central Bank)

Milei ran on dollarizing the Argentine economy—literally getting rid of the peso and using U.S. dollars for everything. This is the monetary policy equivalent of "have you tried turning it off and on again?" except you can't turn it back on. In theory, it solves Argentina's inflation problem by outsourcing monetary policy to the Federal Reserve. In practice, it means giving up any control over your economy and hoping Jerome Powell's decisions for the U.S. economy happen to work for Argentina too. (Spoiler: they probably won't.) What's fascinating is that Milei hasn't actually dollarized yet, but he's done something almost as radical—he's drained the central bank's balance sheet, slashed money printing, and let the peso float freely. The peso, which everyone expected to collapse, has instead appreciated 20% against the dollar since August. This is bonkers. The conventional wisdom was that ending capital controls would trigger massive capital flight. Instead, Argentines who had been hoarding dollars under their mattresses (literally a thing there) started bringing them back into the financial system because the peso looked stable for the first time in decades. There's a lesson here about credibility: if people believe you'll actually stick to a policy, markets can adjust in ways that seem impossible beforehand. The dollarization debate continues, but Milei has basically achieved dollarization-lite by making the peso behave like a dollar-pegged currency without formally pegging it.

## The Big Issue 2: Chainsaw Economics—The Fiscal Adjustment

Milei's signature move is his chainsaw, which he literally brought to campaign rallies to symbolize cutting government spending. (American politicians take note: props work.) He's delivered on the metaphor with genuinely brutal austerity. The budget deficit went from 5% of GDP to a surplus in less than a year. How? He cut subsidies for energy, transport, and everything else, fired tens of thousands of government employees, and eliminated entire ministries. (The Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity was abolished on his first day, which tells you something about his priorities.) The economic pain has been real—poverty rates spiked, real wages declined, and small businesses closed en masse. But here's the thing: the fiscal arithmetic works. Argentina's debt-to-GDP ratio is actually declining, interest rates on sovereign bonds have fallen from "junk" territory to "maybe we'll get paid back" levels, and the country is running a trade surplus for the first time in years. The IMF, which has been burned by Argentina more times than Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy's football, is cautiously optimistic. They approved a new $20 billion program in October, contingent on continued fiscal discipline. Markets believe Milei will stick to austerity because he's ideologically committed to small government in a way that normal politicians aren't. The risk, obviously, is social explosion—but so far, enough Argentines are willing to endure pain for the promise of stability that he's survived politically.

## The Big Issue 3: The Trump-Milei Bromance and $40 Billion

In November, the Trump administration announced a $40 billion support package for Argentina: $20 billion in currency swaps and $20 billion in debt facility investments. This is extraordinary. The U.S. doesn't usually do this kind of direct bilateral support outside of wartime allies or strategic crises. So why Argentina? Because Milei is Trump's ideological soulmate—a libertarian populist who hates "woke culture," loves free markets, and wants to dismantle the administrative state. This is geopolitics disguised as economics. China has been making inroads across South America for years through Belt and Road infrastructure investments. By backing Milei financially, the Trump administration is trying to lock Argentina into the American orbit and create a template for rolling back leftist governance across the continent. For Argentina, the money is a lifeline—it stabilizes the currency, provides fiscal breathing room, and signals to markets that Uncle Sam has Argentina's back. But it's also a trap: if Milei's experiment fails and the $40 billion vanishes into another Argentine default (which is entirely possible), it will be a massive geopolitical embarrassment for Trump. And if it succeeds, it validates shock therapy economics in a way that development economists have been arguing about for decades. Either way, Argentina has become the test case for whether you can actually shock your way to prosperity.

## The International Angle

Argentina's transformation matters globally because it's testing three big questions: Can a major economy actually dollarize successfully? Can shock therapy austerity work without triggering political collapse? And can the U.S. use financial backing to reshape South American politics? For Brazil and Chile, which have their own economic challenges, Argentina is both inspiration and warning. For the IMF, it's a chance to rehabilitate the Washington Consensus after years of criticism. For China, it's a setback—Milei canceled multiple Belt and Road projects and has explicitly aligned with the West. And for bond investors globally, Argentina is the ultimate high-risk, high-reward play. Ten-year bonds that were trading at 40 cents on the dollar a year ago are now at 65 cents—if Milei succeeds, they'll go to par and make investors rich. If he fails, well, it's Argentina; default is always an option.

## The Bottom Line

Milei has bought himself time and credibility through genuinely radical economic policy, but the hard part is sustaining it. Inflation is down, the peso is stable, and fiscal accounts are improving—but poverty is high, growth is negative, and social patience has limits. The Trump bailout gives him breathing room, but also raises the stakes: failure now isn't just Argentine failure, it's American failure. One way to think about this: Argentina is running a real-time experiment in whether libertarian economics can save a country that's tried everything else. So far, it's working better than anyone expected. Which doesn't mean it will keep working, but it does mean the world is watching.`,

    name: "Bolivia",
    lat: -16.2902,

    summary: `# Bolivia - Economy & Business

Bolivia is experiencing something that shouldn't be possible: running out of dollars despite sitting on one of the world's largest lithium deposits. (It's like Saudi Arabia running out of money while swimming in oil.) The dollar shortage has gotten so bad that the official exchange rate is 6.96 bolivianos per dollar, but on the black market it's 11.5—a 65% premium. Banks are rationing dollar withdrawals to $200 per day, import businesses are collapsing because they can't pay suppliers, and the government is burning through foreign reserves trying to maintain the currency peg. Meanwhile, Luis Arce's government nationalized hydrocarbon production years ago and managed to run the sector into the ground, fuel imports now exceed fuel exports, and inflation hit 20% in October. The country elected right-wing president Rodrigo Paz in November promising "capitalism for all," which is genuinely revolutionary language in a country that spent nearly two decades under socialist governance. The economic crisis is so severe that the World Bank called it Bolivia's worst in 40 years. This is what happens when commodity nationalism meets fiscal reality: you get neither commodities nor fiscal sustainability.

## The Big Issue 1: The Dollar Crisis and Black Market Premium

Here's a fun question: Why would a country voluntarily destroy its foreign exchange market? Bolivia has maintained a fixed exchange rate for the boliviano since 2011—6.96 to the dollar—which worked fine when commodity prices were high and dollars were flowing in from natural gas and mineral exports. But then gas production declined (because Morales-era nationalization scared off investment), imports exceeded exports, and the central bank started spending down reserves to defend the peg. Foreign reserves dropped from $15 billion in 2014 to under $2 billion today. That's not a gradual decline; that's a bank run in slow motion. The government refuses to devalue the currency because it would be politically catastrophic—Bolivians save in dollars, prices are set in dollars, and devaluation would spike inflation immediately. So instead, they've created a two-tier system: an official rate that's meaningless and a black market where actual business happens. Import businesses need dollars to pay foreign suppliers, but banks won't sell them dollars at the official rate because banks don't have dollars. So importers go to the black market, pay 65% more, and pass the cost to consumers. This is a hidden devaluation—the government claims the currency is stable, but anyone buying imports (which is everyone) is paying black market rates. Eventually, the peg breaks. It always does. The only question is whether it breaks in an orderly devaluation or a catastrophic collapse.

## The Big Issue 2: The Lithium Paradox

Bolivia has 23 million tons of lithium reserves, the world's second-largest deposit after Chile, sitting in the Uyuni salt flats. Lithium is the "white gold" of the electric vehicle transition—batteries for EVs and energy storage require massive amounts. Bolivia should be rich. Instead, it's broke. Why? Because the socialist government insisted on maintaining state control over lithium extraction, demanded technology transfer from foreign companies, and generally made investment impossible. Every lithium project became a nationalist political football, and nothing got built. Chile and Argentina, which share the "lithium triangle" with Bolivia, took the opposite approach: they invited foreign investment, offered reasonable terms, and now produce actual lithium that generates actual revenue. Bolivia produces almost none. The new Paz government is promising to change this—open the sector to private investment, offer competitive contracts, and finally monetize the resource. But here's the problem: developing lithium deposits takes years and billions in upfront capital, and investors have been burned by Bolivia before. Every time a new government comes in, it renegotiates or nationalizes previous deals. So why would Tesla or Albemarle or any serious lithium company invest in Bolivia when they can invest in Chile or Australia with far less political risk? The resource is valuable, but the institutions are broken, and fixing institutions takes longer than drilling wells.

## The Big Issue 3: Paz's "Capitalism for All" Challenge

Rodrigo Paz's slogan—"capitalism for all"—is both politically clever and economically ambitious. Politically clever because it positions markets as inclusive rather than elitist, which defuses leftist criticism. Economically ambitious because he's trying to dismantle 19 years of socialist economic policy while managing a dollar crisis, fuel shortages, and 20% inflation. The fiscal situation is a disaster: the government runs deficits funded by central bank money printing, which causes inflation, which drives demand for dollars, which drains reserves. It's a doom loop. Paz needs to cut subsidies (fuel, food, utilities), attract foreign investment, and restructure state enterprises that hemorrhage money. But every subsidy cut hits poor Bolivians who were promised these benefits by the MAS government, and every privatization attempt triggers protests by unions who view state ownership as a political achievement. The IMF is watching carefully—Bolivia hasn't had an IMF program in years because the left viewed the Fund as imperialist, but now Paz needs external financing, which means IMF conditionality, which means austerity, which means protests. One way to think about this: Bolivia spent 19 years building an economic model based on high commodity prices and state control, and now both assumptions have collapsed. Fixing it requires not just policy changes but a fundamental shift in political culture. That's not a two-year project; it's a generational one.

## The International Angle

Bolivia's crisis matters because it's a cautionary tale about resource nationalism. China has watched Bolivia's lithium paralysis closely—Beijing invested heavily in Bolivia during the Morales years, but got little return. Now China is pivoting to Chile and Argentina, which actually produce lithium. The U.S. sees Bolivia as part of a broader reshaping of South American politics: Argentina went libertarian, Ecuador went conservative, Bolivia ended socialist rule, and suddenly the Trump administration has geopolitical momentum. For the IMF, Bolivia could be a comeback story: if Paz accepts IMF advice and the economy stabilizes, it validates structural adjustment after years of left-wing critique. For lithium markets, Bolivia is the sleeping giant—if Paz can unlock even a fraction of the Uyuni reserves, it shifts global supply dynamics for EVs. But that's a big "if." Investors have heard Bolivian promises before.

## The Bottom Line

Bolivia is the country that should be rich but isn't, and the reason is almost entirely political. The lithium is real, the demand is real, but the institutional dysfunction is also real. Paz has a genuine reform mandate, American and IMF backing, and a crisis so severe that radical change is possible. But fixing Bolivia's economy requires fixing Bolivia's politics, which requires convincing a population that's been told for two decades that capitalism is exploitation. The dollar shortage will get worse before it gets better, inflation isn't going away soon, and the social patience for austerity is limited. If he pulls it off, Bolivia becomes a development success story. If he doesn't, it's another chapter in South American instability.`,

    name: 'Nepal',

    summary: `Nepal is the dream that delivers—unless you arrive expecting pristine trails without crowds. 1.2 million tourists in 2024 (rebounding from 2015 earthquake's devastation and COVID-19 collapse), tourism revenue hitting $1.8B, and Everest Base Camp is now basically a conga line of influencers filming content in North Face jackets. November 2025: Kathmandu's Thamel district is backpacker central with €5 guesthouses and ₹300 momos; Annapurna Circuit is being paved with jeep roads replacing foot trails; and the Nepali government just raised Everest climbing permits to $15,000 (from $11,000) to manage the death-march queues. But here's the truth: Nepal still owns the trekking crown. The Himalayas—8 of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000m—are backdrop to experiences that change lives. Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek is overrun (40,000+ trekkers annually) but still magnificent: 12-day journey through Sherpa villages, yak trains, rhododendron forests, with Ama Dablam and Lhotse looming like gods. Annapurna Circuit (15-21 days) circles the Annapurna massif crossing 5,416m Thorong La Pass—being wrecked by road construction but still epic. Want solitude? Manaslu Circuit (14 days, permit restricted to 500/year), Kanchenjunga (21 days, remote eastern border with India/Sikkim), Upper Dolpo (ancient Tibetan culture, almost nobody goes). Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) are prime—clear skies, moderate temps, busy trails. Monsoon (June-August) is leeches and landslides; winter is freezing at altitude but empty trails. Kathmandu is chaos: Durbar Square's temples (earthquake-damaged but rebuilding), Boudhanath's massive Buddhist stupa (Tibetan refugees selling prayer flags), Pashupatinath's Hindu cremation ghats on Bagmati River (body burning, smoke, sacred rituals). Traffic is maddening (no traffic lights work, motorbikes everywhere, dust masks necessary), air pollution is hazardous (AQI regularly 150+), power cuts are frequent. But Thamel is traveler paradise: gear shops, trekking agencies, restaurants serving dal bhat (rice, lentils, curry—unlimited refills), thukpa (Tibetan noodle soup), momos (dumplings). Hotels range €5-150; budget guesthouses are clean-ish with squat toilets and cold showers; mid-range comfortable. Pokhara (200km west, 7-hour bus or 25-min flight) is the other hub: lakeside town with views of Annapurna range, starting point for treks, paragliding, boating on Phewa Lake. More relaxed than Kathmandu but getting touristy (restaurants with "Free WiFi" and "Banana Pancakes" signs everywhere). Chitwan National Park (south near India border) offers jungle safaris: one-horned rhinos, Bengal tigers (rare sightings), elephants, crocodiles. Jeep safaris and canoe trips are €50-100 for 2-3 days. Lumbini (Buddha's birthplace) is pilgrimage site with monasteries from 20+ countries and Maya Devi Temple marking birth spot. Infrastructure is improving but uneven. Roads are terrible—landslides, potholes, terrifying bus rides on cliff edges (accidents common). Kathmandu-Pokhara highway under expansion but still 7+ hours. Domestic flights (to Pokhara, Lukla for Everest, Jomsom) are weather-dependent and delayed constantly; Lukla is world's most dangerous airport (short mountain runway, crashes happen). Trekking infrastructure is excellent: teahouses every 2-3 hours offering bed (€3-10), dal bhat (€5), charging phones (extra fee). Guides and porters available (guide €25/day, porter €20/day)—employ them, it's ethical and safer. Mobile coverage spotty above 3,000m; WiFi available but slow/expensive. Safety is generally good for tourists—violent crime low (2.1 per 100K). Trekking deaths happen: altitude sickness (4-5 annually on EBC), avalanches, falls, heart attacks. Altitude sickness is real—ascend slowly, acclimatize, carry Diamox. Helicopter rescues cost $5,000-10,000 (insurance essential). Kathmandu has petty theft and scams: fake trekking agencies, taxi overcharging, commission-driven tours. Political instability occasional (protests, strikes/bandhs shut down cities). Women solo: generally safe but harassment in Kathmandu; trekking solo fine with guide. LGBT: not illegal but conservative society, keep low profile. Visa is easy: visa-on-arrival at Kathmandu airport ($30 for 15 days, $50 for 30 days, $125 for 90 days), pay cash or card, bring passport photo. E-visa available online (same price, faster). Fly into Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM)—connections from Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Singapore, Doha. Overland from India (Sunauli, Birgunj borders) possible but slow. Best time: October-November (clear skies, cool temps, peak crowds, Dashain/Tihar festivals); March-May (warmer, rhododendrons blooming, good visibility). December-February is cold/snowy at altitude but fewer trekkers. June-September monsoon is wet, leeches, landslides, poor visibility. Tourism contributes 7.9% of GDP, employs 1M+ (critical for mountain communities' livelihoods). Trekking permits generate $20M+ annually (TIMS cards, national park fees). Climbing permits for 8,000m peaks bring $5M+. Government plans to double tourists to 2M by 2027 (ambitious given infrastructure limits). Sustainability crisis: Everest has 200+ bodies still on mountain, trash problem (clean-up expeditions removing tonnes), overcrowding on popular trails, teahouses causing deforestation. Locals in Khumbu (Everest region) report water scarcity, waste overwhelming villages. Climate change melting glaciers—Imja Lake risk of glacial outburst flood. Hidden gems: Rara Lake (Nepal's largest, far west, stunning blue water, almost no tourists), Tsum Valley (sacred Buddhist valley, restricted permit), Upper Mustang (Tibetan culture, walled city of Lo Manthang, permit expensive $500 for 10 days but worth it). Pokhara's Ghorepani Poon Hill (4-5 day trek, sunrise over Annapurnas, beginner-friendly). **Bottom line:** Nepal is trekking mecca with Himalayan majesty that justifies the hype—if you can tolerate crowds on popular trails, pollution in cities, and infrastructure chaos. EBC and Annapurna Circuit are bucket-list worthy but busy; go off-beaten paths for magic. Budget heaven (€20-30/day possible), incredible hospitality, and mountains that humble you. Just don't expect easy—earthquakes, landslides, altitude sickness, and political instability are part of the package. Go with patience, respect, and proper insurance.`,

  // 2. NETHERLANDS
  {
    name: 'Netherlands',
    lat: 52.3676,
    lng: 4.9041,
    summary: `The Netherlands is Europe's well-oiled machine with legal weed and windmills—except the windmills are museums and Amsterdam is drowning in tourist crowds. 21 million visitors in 2024 (population is 17.8M, so tourists outnumber locals), tourism revenue €82B, and Amsterdam's city center is basically a theme park for bachelor parties and stoned teenagers. November 2025: city government banning smoking weed on streets (new rules cracking down on coffee shops), cruise ships limited to 100/year, and red-light district closing windows to reduce "gawking tourism." Amsterdam is the draw and the problem. Canals (UNESCO World Heritage) are stunning—17th-century canal houses, 1,500+ bridges, boats gliding past leaning facades. Anne Frank House (1M visitors/year, book months ahead €16), Rijksmuseum (Rembrandt's Night Watch, Vermeer, €22.50), Van Gogh Museum (world's largest collection, €22). But it's overrun: Dam Square is pickpocket central, Leidseplein is drunk British tourists, and walking through tourist areas means dodging selfie-sticks and bike-rental chaos. Red-light district (De Wallen) is being gentrified—windows closing, sex workers moved out, replaced by boutiques. Coffee shops (weed legal for purchase/consumption) face restrictions: no tourists allowed in some (Eindhoven/Maastricht), Amsterdam limiting licenses. Weed tourism is still huge (estimated 30% of visitors come for it) but locals are fed up. Smart shops sell magic truffles (legal) for psychedelic experiences. Beyond Amsterdam, the Netherlands is far more pleasant. Utrecht is Amsterdam without the tourists: canals with wharf cellars turned restaurants, Dom Tower (tallest church tower, climb 465 steps), medieval center. Rotterdam is the opposite—ultra-modern architecture (Markthal, Cube Houses, Erasmus Bridge), Europe's largest port, edgy art scene, cheaper than Amsterdam. The Hague (Den Haag) is political capital: International Court of Justice, Parliament, Mauritshuis museum (Vermeer's Girl with Pearl Earring), Scheveningen beach (North Sea, mediocre sand but Dutch love it). Smaller gems: Delft (blue pottery, canals, Vermeer's hometown), Haarlem (medieval streets, Frans Hals Museum), Leiden (university town, birthplace of Rembrandt), Giethoorn ("Venice of the North," car-free village with canals and thatched-roof houses—touristy but charming). Keukenhof Gardens (spring only, March-May) has 7M tulips blooming—iconic but packed. Cycling is the Netherlands' superpower: 22,000 miles of bike paths, 22.5M bikes (more bikes than people), flat terrain perfect for casual riders. Rent a bike (€10-15/day), follow locals' lead (fast-moving, no helmets, bikes have right-of-way). Cycling Amsterdam to Haarlem (20km, easy coastal route) or through tulip fields in spring is quintessential Dutch experience. Infrastructure is world-class: trains (NS) run on time, every 10-30 min between cities, cheap (€20-50 intercity tickets, OV-chipkaart rechargeable card). Schiphol Airport (AMS) is Europe's third-busiest, connects everywhere, 15-min train to Amsterdam. Buses, trams, metros clean and punctual. Walking cities—Amsterdam, Utrecht, Haarlem—are compact and navigable. English fluency is near-universal (90%+ speak English). Food is underrated: stroopwafels (caramel waffle cookies), bitterballen (fried meatballs), poffertjes (mini pancakes), herring (raw fish with onions, traditional), cheese (Gouda, Edam markets). Indonesian food (colonial legacy) is excellent: rijsttafel (rice table with 20+ dishes). Restaurants expensive (€15-40 mains) but cafes offer cheaper brown-cafe stamppot (mashed potatoes with veg and sausage, hearty). Craft beer scene is booming (beyond Heineken). Cannabis cafes serve space cakes/brownies (edibles hit hard, be cautious). Hotels are pricey: Amsterdam €100-400/night, other cities €60-200. Airbnb crackdown in Amsterdam (max 30 days/year rental, enforcement strict). Hostels €30-60 for dorms. Safety is high—violent crime rare (0.6 per 100K, Europe's safest). Bicycle theft is epidemic (locks essential, expect bike stolen if not secured). Pickpocketing in Amsterdam tourist areas. Scams: unofficial bike rentals, overpriced tourist trap cafes near Dam Square. Drug dealers selling fake cocaine/MDMA (stick to licensed coffee shops for weed). Cycling accidents happen (tourists unfamiliar with bike lanes cause crashes). Women solo: very safe. LGBT: Amsterdam is queer haven (Pride, gay marriage since 2001, Canal Parade). Muslims face some discrimination (far-right politics rising). Visa: Americans, Canadians, Australians, 60+ countries get visa-free 90 days Schengen. EU citizens unlimited. Fly into Schiphol (AMS)—direct flights from 300+ cities globally. Train from Brussels (1h50), Paris (3h20), London (4h via Eurostar), Berlin (6h20). Driving not recommended (parking €50+/day in cities, bike/transit better). Best time: April-May (tulips, King's Day orange madness April 27, mild weather); September-October (fewer crowds, autumn colors). June-August is peak (good weather, crowded, expensive). Winter (Nov-Feb) is gray, cold, rainy but museums empty and cheaper. Christmas markets in December charming. Tourism contributes 4.5% of GDP, €82B annually, employs 750K. But "overtourism" is official crisis: Amsterdam limiting hotel construction, cruise ships capped, marketing campaigns telling tourists to stay away. Locals priced out of housing (short-term rentals drove rents up 40% in decade). City plans "tourist tax" increase from €3 to €12.50/night by 2026. Hidden gems disappearing: Giethoorn is Instagram-famous now (boat tours €10-20, packed in summer), Zaanse Schans windmills are tourist trap (free entry but surrounded by souvenir shops). Real hidden gems: Texel Island (largest Wadden Island, cycling, beaches, seals, quiet), Kinderdijk windmills (19 UNESCO mills, less touristy than Zaanse Schans), Hoge Veluwe National Park (forests, heathlands, Kröller-Müller Museum with Van Goghs, free white bikes to explore). Northern provinces (Friesland, Groningen) are overlooked—canals, lakes, traditional villages, almost no tourists. **Bottom line:** Netherlands is efficient, tolerant, bike-friendly wonderland with world-class art and architecture—but Amsterdam is victim of its own success. Go to Utrecht, Rotterdam, The Hague instead; cycle through countryside; visit in shoulder season. Tourist-trap Amsterdam still worth seeing but manage expectations (crowded, expensive, Disneyland-ified). The Dutch have built a near-perfect society—good transit, social safety net, progressive values—and tourism is threatening to ruin it. Visit responsibly or stick to smaller cities.`,
    issues: ['21M tourists vs 17.8M population', 'Amsterdam overtourism crisis, new restrictions', 'Visa-free 90 days Schengen', 'Infrastructure world-class', 'Weed/red-light tourism being curtailed', 'Locals priced out by tourism housing demand']

    name: 'New Zealand',
    lat: -40.9006,
    lng: 174.8860,
    summary: `New Zealand is the adventure playground at the end of the world—stunning landscapes, Māori culture, and hobbits. 3.1 million tourists in 2024 (recovering toward pre-COVID 3.9M in 2019), tourism revenue $18.2B NZD, and the country's betting its post-COVID future on high-value travelers instead of backpacker hordes. November 2025: international visitor tax raised to $100 NZD (from $35), conservation fees at national parks introduced, and Queenstown's rental crisis has workers living in vans because tourists filled every house. New Zealand is two islands of contrasts. North Island: Auckland (1.7M people, 1/3 of population)—harbor city with Sky Tower, waterfront, volcanic cones, Polynesian vibe. It's functional but not beautiful; use it as transit hub. Wellington (capital) is cooler literally and figuratively—windy, hilly, Te Papa national museum (free, excellent Māori exhibits), craft coffee culture, film industry (Wētā Workshop tours show Lord of the Rings/Avatar effects). Rotorua is geothermal wonderland: bubbling mud pools, geysers, sulfur smell everywhere, Māori cultural experiences (haka performances, hāngī earth oven feasts). Waitomo Caves (glowworms illuminating underground rivers, boat tours $60-140). Bay of Islands (north) is sailing paradise: 144 islands, dolphins, Māori Treaty of Waitangi historic site. Tongariro Alpine Crossing (day hike, 19.4km, volcanic landscapes, emerald lakes, challenging but stunning). South Island is the star. Queenstown is adrenaline capital: bungee jumping (birthplace of commercial bungee), skydiving, paragliding, jet boating (Shotover River canyons), skiing (Remarkables, Coronet Peak). Stunning setting on Lake Wakatipu with mountains all around. But it's expensive (hotels $200-600/night, meals $25-50) and overcrowded in peak season. Nearby: Milford Sound (fjord with waterfalls, rainforest, Mitre Peak—boat cruises $100-200, often rainy but dramatic). Fiordland National Park is remote wilderness—kayaking, multi-day treks (Milford Track, Routeburn Track). West Coast: Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers (heli-hikes $400-600, climate change melting them fast), Punakaiki Pancake Rocks (layered limestone formations). Christchurch (South Island's largest city) rebuilding after 2011 earthquake—modern architecture, Botanic Gardens, punt boats on Avon River, gateway to Aoraki/Mount Cook (highest peak 3,724m, climbing, stargazing). Southern Scenic Route less traveled: Catlins (waterfalls, seal colonies, penguins), Dunedin (Scottish heritage, albatross colony, Baldwin Street—world's steepest residential street). Abel Tasman National Park (north coast) is beaches and coastal hiking—kayaking, golden sand, turquoise water, seals. Nelson region is sunny, wine country, arts scene. Infrastructure excellent: rental cars everywhere ($40-100/day, drive on left), roads scenic but winding (South Island passes close in winter snow). Campervans popular (freedom camping restricted now—must use designated sites, fines for illegal camping). Buses (InterCity) connect cities but slow; domestic flights (Air New Zealand) fast but pricey ($100-300). Trains scenic but limited: TranzAlpine (Christchurch to Greymouth, stunning Alps crossing, $150-250). Accommodation ranges budget hostels ($30-60 dorms) to luxury lodges ($500-2,000/night). DOC (Department of Conservation) runs 950+ huts and campsites in national parks ($5-65/night, book ahead for Great Walks). Food: meat pies, fish and chips, pavlova (meringue dessert), hokey pokey ice cream. Lamb is excellent. Māori hāngī (earth oven) is traditional feast. Wine regions: Marlborough (Sauvignon Blanc), Central Otago (Pinot Noir), Hawke's Bay. Craft beer scene strong. Restaurants expensive ($20-50 mains). Supermarkets (Countdown, New World) for self-catering. Safety very high—violent crime 2.9 per 100K, one of world's safest. Nature hazards: earthquakes (fault lines, tremors common), volcanic activity (White Island erupted 2019 killing tourists), weather changes fast in mountains (hypothermia risk). Hiking deaths 6-10/year (falls, river crossings, exposure). Kea birds (alpine parrots) steal food, damage cars. Sandflies on South Island west coast are vicious (insect repellent essential). No snakes, no dangerous animals (except aggressive possums). Women solo: extremely safe. LGBT: progressive (gay marriage, Pride events). Māori-Pākehā (European) relations generally good but complex colonial history. Visa: Americans, Canadians, EU, 60+ countries get visa-free NZeTA (electronic travel authority, $12-23 online, includes tourist levy $35, apply before travel). Up to 90 days. Australians unlimited (special relationship). Fly into Auckland (AKL) or Christchurch (CHC)—connections from Australia, Asia, US, Pacific. No direct Europe flights (stopover in Asia). Auckland-Sydney 3 hours, Auckland-LA 12 hours. Best time: December-February (summer, warmest, peak crowds/prices, Christmas/New Year busy). March-May (autumn, mild, fewer tourists, golden landscapes). June-August (winter, skiing season Queenstown/Wānaka, cold/rainy elsewhere). September-November (spring, wildflowers, lambing season, good value). Weather unpredictable—"four seasons in one day." Tourism contributes 5.5% of GDP, $18B NZD, employs 230K. Government shifted strategy post-COVID toward "high-value" tourists (luxury travelers spending more, staying longer) instead of backpackers (who spend less, freedom camp, strain infrastructure). New $100 visitor tax funds conservation. Queenstown has housing crisis—tourism workers can't afford rent ($400-600/week for room), living in cars/vans. Overtourism hitting Milford Sound (traffic jams, parking full, cruise ships banned to reduce impact), Tongariro Crossing (2,000/day in peak, erosion), Franz Josef (helicopter noise complaints). Climate change threat: glaciers retreating (Franz Josef lost 3km since 1980), ski season shortening, extreme weather events increasing. Hidden gems: Stewart Island (New Zealand's third island, south of South Island—kiwi birds, hiking, 400 residents, almost no tourists), Coromandel Peninsula (beaches, hot water beach you dig own spa pool, Cathedral Cove), Whanganui River (canoe journey, Māori spiritual significance), Forgotten World Highway (remote north island road through gorges, tunnels, tiny towns). **Bottom line:** New Zealand delivers on natural beauty—fjords, mountains, glaciers, beaches—with adventure activities everywhere and safe, easy travel. But it's expensive (everything costs more at world's edge), distances deceive (takes longer to drive than map suggests), and top spots are crowded. Go in shoulder season, explore beyond Queenstown/Milford, respect Māori culture, and budget $100-200/day minimum. If you're into outdoors, it's paradise. If you hate hiking, stick to wine regions. The landscapes are Middle-earth made real.`,

  // 4. NICARAGUA
  {
    name: 'Nicaragua',
    lat: 12.8654,
    lng: -85.2072,
    summary: `Nicaragua is Central America's most beautiful disaster—volcanic lakes, surf breaks, colonial cities, and a dictatorship that scares tourists away. 570,000 tourists in 2023 (down from 1.4M in 2017 before political crisis), tourism revenue $350M, and the Ortega regime is desperately trying to revive the sector while jailing journalists and crushing dissent. November 2025: U.S. State Department warning "reconsider travel" (Level 3), European tourists staying away, and expat communities in San Juan del Sur and Granada are quietly leaving as police state tightens. Nicaragua was Central America's next big thing in the 2010s: cheaper than Costa Rica, less violent than Honduras, stunning Pacific beaches, colonial Granada. Then 2018 protests happened—Daniel Ortega's police killed 300+ demonstrators, jailed opposition leaders, shut independent media—and tourism collapsed. It's slowly recovering but the vibe is tense. Granada is the jewel: colonial Spanish architecture with colorful buildings, Parque Central with yellow cathedral, horse carriages, Lake Nicaragua (largest lake in Central America) lapping the shore. Isletas de Granada—365 tiny islands—are boat tour ($30, monkeys, birds, rich Nicaraguans' vacation homes). Mombacho Volcano cloud forest hiking. It's charming but watch what you say—police informants, opposition symbols forbidden. Hotels $25-150, restaurants $5-20. León (north) is the revolutionary city: colonial churches (largest cathedral in Central America), Sandinist murals, political history tours. Cerro Negro volcano (active black cinder cone)—hike up, board down on sleds ($30-40, thrilling/terrifying). León is hotter, grittier than Granada, more authentic. San Juan del Sur (Pacific coast) is surf town: hostels full of backpackers, beach bars, yoga retreats, sunset parties. Beaches are gorgeous—Playa Maderas (surf lessons $25-40), Playa Hermosa (quiet cove), Playa Remanso (long sand). But growing fast, losing charm. Sunday Funday pool crawl (bar-hopping on party bus) is infamous. Corn Islands (Caribbean coast) are off-grid paradise: turquoise water, white sand, coconut palms, reggae vibes, snorkeling, diving. Little Corn (no cars, walk/bike only) is more laid-back; Big Corn has airport and more development. $50-100 hotels, $10 lobster dinners. Getting there: 1-hour flight from Managua ($120-180) or overnight boat (rough seas, not recommended). Ometepe Island (Lake Nicaragua) has two volcanoes (Concepción active, Maderas dormant with crater lake), petroglyphs, jungle, monkeys. Kayak, hike, rent scooter to explore. Rustic accommodations $15-60. Ferry from San Jorge (1 hour, $2-3). Infrastructure is rough: roads are potholed, buses are old school chickens (retired U.S. school buses, colorful, crowded, cheap—$1-5 intercity). Rental cars $30-60/day but roads dangerous (potholes, no lights, animals). Managua (capital) is ugly, sprawling, skippable except for airport. Domestic flights to Corn Islands, Bluefields (Caribbean). Taxis cheap but negotiate first (no meters). Hostels $8-20, mid-range hotels $40-100, boutique $150+. Food is cheap: gallo pinto (rice and beans, breakfast staple), nacatamal (corn tamale with meat), vigorón (yucca, cabbage salad, pork rinds), indio viejo (corn stew). Fresh fruit juices, Toña/Victoria beer, Flor de Caña rum (world-class, cheap). Meals $3-10 local, $15-30 tourist spots. Safety is complicated: violent crime lower than neighbors (3.6 per 100K vs 25+ in Honduras) but political repression is real. Criticizing Ortega regime can get you arrested (vague "terrorism" laws). Don't photograph government buildings, police, military. Protests are illegal. Petty crime: bag snatching in Managua, pickpocketing in markets. Gang activity in barrios. Avoid Managua at night. Buses get robbed on remote routes. San Juan del Sur has drug/alcohol issues (overdoses, assaults at hostels). Corn Islands safe but isolated. Women solo: generally okay but catcalling common, avoid walking alone at night. LGBT: legal but conservative Catholic society, keep low profile. Visa: Americans, Canadians, EU, Australians get 90 days visa-free at entry ($10 tourist card at border/airport). Overland from Costa Rica (Peñas Blancas border) or Honduras (El Espino, Guasaule). Fly into Managua (MGA)—connections from Miami, Houston, Panama City, San Salvador. Best time: November-April (dry season, hot but no rain, surf swells). May-October (rainy season, afternoon downpours, cheaper, greener). Hurricane season June-November (risk of storms). December-January peak (Christmas/New Year, prices up). Tourism contributes 3.2% of GDP (down from 6% pre-2018 crisis), $350M/year, employs 100K. Government desperate to rebuild but refuses to reform politically. Ortega closed 3,000+ NGOs including tourism groups. Expats report business licenses revoked arbitrarily, property seized. Future uncertain—if regime continues crackdown, tourism won't recover. If opposition somehow wins (unlikely—elections are rigged), could boom. Hidden gems few because country small and most places known. Río San Juan (river connecting Lake Nicaragua to Caribbean, jungle, wildlife, remote) is undeveloped. Masaya Volcano National Park (active lava lake visible at night, $8 entry, eerie glow). Northern mountains (Estelí, Matagalpa) are cooler, coffee country, less touristy. **Bottom line:** Nicaragua has the goods—volcanoes, surf, lakes, colonial charm, ridiculously cheap prices ($30-50/day budget)—but Ortega's dictatorship makes it ethically murky and potentially risky. Tourism dollars support regime; some expats say boycott, others say local people need income. If you go, stay apolitical, don't trust locals who seem too interested in your opinions, avoid political topics. The natural beauty and warmth of Nicaraguan people deserve better government. Visit if you're comfortable with contradictions; skip if political repression bothers you.`,

  // 5. NIGERIA
  {
    name: 'Nigeria',
    lat: 9.0820,
    lng: 8.6753,
    summary: `Nigeria is Africa's giant that tourism forgot—230 million people, Nollywood, afrobeats, incredible culture, and absolutely brutal security situation that keeps visitors near zero. 2.9 million tourists in 2023 (mostly diaspora returning to visit family), tourism revenue $2.1B, and the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation has big dreams but faces kidnappings, terrorism, infrastructure collapse, and corruption that make leisure tourism nearly impossible. November 2025: Boko Haram still active in northeast, bandits kidnapping hundreds in northwest, Lagos traffic so bad it takes 3 hours to cross the city, and the Naira devaluation (₦1,540 = $1 in November 2025) makes Nigeria cheaper but economy is chaos. Here's the reality: Lagos is the only real tourism destination and it's challenging. Africa's largest city (15M+ people officially, probably 20M+ actually), economic powerhouse, cultural explosion of music, fashion, art, nightlife. Victoria Island and Ikoyi are the wealthy enclaves: high-rise apartments, shopping malls (The Palms, Lekki), beach clubs, restaurants serving jollof rice ($5-15), suya (spiced meat skewers), egusi soup (melon seed stew). Nike Art Gallery is stunning—four floors of Nigerian art, textiles, sculptures, hosted Queen Elizabeth. Lekki Conservation Centre has canopy walkway through coastal forests. Freedom Park (former colonial prison turned cultural center) hosts concerts, festivals. Nightlife is world-class: clubs in Victoria Island (Quilox, Club 57) go until dawn, afrobeats stars DJ, bottle service expensive ($200+). But Lagos is exhausting: traffic is apocalyptic (average commute 2+ hours, "go-slow" gridlock everywhere), air pollution terrible, power cuts constant (generators essential), flooding during rains (inadequate drainage). Crime is serious—armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping-for-ransom (especially of wealthy Nigerians and foreigners). Stick to VIP areas, don't walk at night, use trusted drivers, avoid public transport. Police are corrupt (roadblock bribes expected). Abuja (capital, central Nigeria) is planned city: cleaner, less chaotic than Lagos, government buildings, Zuma Rock (725m monolith), Millennium Park. Safer than Lagos but still kidnappings on highways outside city. Business travelers only, nothing much for tourists. Northern Nigeria (Kano, Kaduna, Maiduguri) is off-limits—Boko Haram in northeast has killed 40,000+ since 2009, kidnapped thousands (including 276 Chibok schoolgirls 2014). Northwest has bandit gangs kidnapping entire villages for ransom. U.S./UK warn "do not travel" to most northern states. Calabar (southeast coast) hosts Calabar Carnival (December, massive street parade called "Africa's biggest carnival"). Obudu Mountain Resort (Cross River State) is highland retreat with cable car, cool climate, hiking—underutilized. Yankari National Park (Bauchi State) has elephants, hippos, warm springs—but insecurity makes it risky to reach. Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove (UNESCO site, Yoruba forest sanctuary with shrines, sculptures) is cultural treasure near Osogbo—pilgrimage site. Infrastructure is Nigeria's Achilles heel: roads are death traps (potholes, no lights, overloaded trucks, 20 road deaths per 100K—world's worst). Domestic flights (Arik Air, Air Peace) delayed constantly, overbooked, luggage lost. Lagos airport (LOS) is chaotic, corrupt officials demanding bribes. Power grid fails daily (hotels/homes run diesel generators). Internet spotty. Water quality poor (bottled water only). Hotels in Lagos range $60-400/night (midrange $100-200 for acceptable quality). Budget accommodations risky. Abuja similar. Food is excellent: jollof rice (tomato rice, national pride—Nigerians claim theirs beats Ghana's), egusi soup, pounded yam with ogbono soup, pepper soup (spicy fish/meat broth), moi moi (bean pudding), plantains. Street food risky (hygiene). Suya is safe (grilled fresh). Star beer, Trophy beer, palm wine. Restaurants $5-30. Afrobeats concerts, festivals (Felabration honoring Fela Kuti, Detty December December parties) are cultural highlights. Safety is the deal-breaker: armed robbery common, kidnappings-for-ransom targeting foreigners ($50K-500K ransoms), terrorism in north, police brutality (EndSARS protests 2020 over police violence), corruption everywhere. "Yahoo boys" (internet scammers) target foreigners with romance/business scams. Cybercrime capital (financial fraud everywhere). Violent crime 9.8 per 100K (underreported). Women solo: not recommended (harassment, safety risks). LGBT: illegal (14 years prison), violent homophobia, extreme danger. Religious tensions: Muslim north vs Christian south, occasional clashes. Visa is nightmare: Nigerian e-visa system dysfunctional ($160-200, weeks/months processing, often rejected without reason), visa-on-arrival suspended since COVID. Need invitation letter, proof of funds, hotel bookings. Yellow fever vaccine required (certificate checked). Fly into Lagos (LOS) or Abuja (ABV)—connections from London, Dubai, Johannesburg, Atlanta, Istanbul. Overland borders from Benin, Niger, Cameroon are corruption zones (bribes expected). Best time: November-February (dry season, cooler 25-30°C, harmattan dust from Sahara can reduce visibility). March-October rainy season (flooding, humidity, mosquitoes, malaria risk high). December is "Detty December" (parties, diaspora returns, expensive). Tourism contributes 1.2% of GDP, $2.1B (tiny for 230M people), employs 300K directly. Potential is enormous—richest culture in Africa, 250+ ethnic groups, Nollywood is world's second-largest film industry (1,000+ films/year), music stars like Burna Boy, Wizkid, Tems global. But security collapse, corruption, infrastructure failure make it non-starter for tourists. Business travelers pay premium for security (armored cars, armed guards). Hidden gems inaccessible: Olumo Rock (Abeokuta, granite outcrop with caves), Erin-Ijesha Waterfalls (seven-tier cascade), Tarkwa Bay Beach (Lagos, boat access only, palm-fringed sand). Niger Delta wetlands have biodiversity but oil pollution devastated environment. **Bottom line:** Nigeria is for Nigerians and diaspora, not leisure tourists. Lagos has energy, culture, nightlife that rivals global cities—but crime, traffic, corruption, infrastructure failure make it punishing. Northern Nigeria is dangerous war zone. Unless you have business, family, or strong cultural interest, skip Nigeria. If you must go: hire trusted driver/guide, stay in secure areas (VIP neighborhoods), don't flash wealth, get yellow fever vaccine, bring cash (ATMs unreliable), expect bribes, chaos, and frustration. Rewards are Nigerian warmth, culture, food—but risks outweigh them for most. Wait for government to fix security, which could be never.`,

  // 6. NORTH KOREA
  {
    name: 'North Korea',
    lat: 39.0392,
    lng: 125.7625,
    summary: `North Korea is the world's most totalitarian theme park—staged tours, weeping guides, fake villages, and zero freedom. 4,000 Western tourists annually (mostly via China, pre-COVID), 100,000 Chinese tourists, tourism revenue classified secret, and Kim Jong Un wants more foreign currency but won't loosen control that makes visits Kafkaesque nightmares. November 2025: borders still mostly closed since COVID-19 (re-opening slowly to Chinese groups only), Otto Warmbier's 2017 death (American student arrested for "stealing poster," coma, died after release) haunts Western tourism agencies, and the few tour companies operating (Young Pioneer Tours, Koryo Tours) face ethical questions: does tourism legitimize regime? Pyongyang is the sanitized capital: Juche Tower (170m monument to Kim Il Sung's ideology, $5 to climb, city views), Kim Il Sung Square (massive parade ground, goose-stepping soldiers), Grand People's Study House (library, propaganda), Mansudae Grand Monument (giant Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il statues, mandatory bowing). Ryugyong Hotel (105-story pyramid, "Hotel of Doom"—unfinished since 1987, LED lights added but uninhabitable). Metro system (deepest in world at 110m, doubling as bomb shelter, ornate stations with chandeliers, murals). DMZ/Panmunjom (border with South Korea, joint security area, tense standoff). Outside Pyongyang: Kaesong (ancient capital, DMZ views, ginseng), Mount Myohyang (scenic, International Friendship Exhibition showcasing gifts to Kims from world leaders—bizarre collection of silver crocodiles, bullet-proof Mercedes, etc.). Mount Paektu (sacred volcano on China border, birthplace mythology of Kim Jong Il). East coast beaches (Wonsan, Hamhung)—regime trying to develop resorts. Tours are Orwellian: you MUST join organized group (no independent travel), two government minders accompany 24/7 (watching, listening, reporting), itinerary fixed (no deviation), photos restricted (can't photograph soldiers, poor people, construction, military—minders approve each shot), interaction with locals scripted (they're told what to say). Accommodations: Yanggakdo Hotel (Pyongyang, island location trapping guests, revolving restaurant, basement floors off-limits). Meals at state restaurants (mediocre food, cold noodles, kimchi, mystery meat). No internet, no phone calls out, no freedom. Fake villages (Kijong-dong DMZ "Peace Village" is empty Potemkin village with fake buildings). Schoolchildren performing flawlessly is propaganda (practiced for months). Infrastructure is frozen in 1970s: Pyongyang has electricity (mostly), provinces dark at night (satellite photos show North Korea as black void). Air Koryo (state airline, 1-star rated, Soviet-era planes, flies Pyongyang-Beijing). Roads empty except military vehicles. No private cars (only officials). Inter-city travel by train (slow, decrepit) or bus (minders-controlled). Food is rationed (most citizens malnourished), but tourists eat better (state-run restaurants, mediocre quality). Taedonggang beer (surprisingly okay). No Western food (sanctions). Safety depends on obedience: follow rules exactly, never criticize regime, don't bring banned items (Bible, South Korean media, U.S. propaganda), bow to Kim statues, don't refuse participation. Punishment for "crimes" is severe—labor camps, execution. Otto Warmbier stole poster, sentenced 15 years hard labor, returned comatose (torture suspected), died. Kenneth Bae (American missionary) held 735 days. Defectors report torture, starvation in camps. Medical care primitive (bring all medications, insurance useless). Women: same risks as men. LGBT: illegal, death penalty possible. Visa requires tour company to arrange ($50-100, but tour package is $1,500-3,000 for 5-7 days). Americans banned from entering since 2017 (unless special permission from State Department, rarely granted). Chinese get easier access. Entry via Beijing on Air Koryo flight (2h) or train (24h). Must surrender passport, phones searched, luggage inspected. Exit same. Banned items confiscated. Best time: April (Kim Il Sung birthday April 15, military parades, Mass Games if held), September (cooler, autumn colors). Winter freezing (-20°C, no heating). Summer hot, humid. Mass Games (gymnastics/performance with 100,000 performers) are spectacular propaganda—held irregularly, ticket $100-300 via tour. Tourism revenue unknown (regime secret), estimated $100M+/year (mostly Chinese). Hard currency critical for regime (sanctions block other income). Ethical debate: tourism funds nuclear weapons program vs provides rare window into closed society. Tour companies defend "people-to-people" contact; critics say it's propaganda validation. Hidden gems don't exist—you see only what regime allows. No spontaneity, no real interactions, no truth. It's curated dystopia. Mount Paektu is beautiful (crater lake, volcanic landscape) but wrapped in Kim family mythology. Beaches are empty (citizens can't access). **Bottom line:** North Korea is not tourism, it's performance art where you're the audience and prisoner simultaneously. If you're fascinated by totalitarianism, propaganda, Cold War relics, it's darkly compelling—but know you're funding regime, supporting illusion, and risking arrest for unknowable "crimes." Ethical questions are serious: should you go? If you do, you'll see nothing real—only what Kim wants. It's expensive ($2,000-3,000 for week), restrictive, morally complicated, and potentially dangerous. Most travelers say it's unforgettable but wouldn't repeat. Some regret supporting regime. If you're American, don't—State Department ban exists for reason (Otto Warmbier). If you're from other country, wrestle with ethics before booking. There are no hidden gems, no authentic experiences, no freedom—just the world's most elaborate lie.`,

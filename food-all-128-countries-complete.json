      "summary": "Afghan cuisine is all about layered rice, slow-cooked meats, and the intoxicating perfume of cardamom. Kabuli pulao—the national dish—is a masterclass in technique: basmati rice steamed with lamb stock until each grain is separate and glossy, topped with tender chunks of lamb, sweet caramelized carrots, and raisins. The rice underneath gets crispy (tahdig-style), and that contrast between fluffy and crunchy is everything. Afghans take their rice seriously; it's not just a side, it's the main event. Mantou (steamed dumplings filled with onions and beef, topped with yogurt and split peas) and ashak (leek-filled dumplings with meat sauce) showcase Central Asian dumpling traditions. The yogurt here is thick, tangy, and used generously—it cuts through rich meat dishes and adds that probiotic punch.\n\nStreet food centers around fresh naan from tandoor ovens—the bread is pillowy with charred spots, eaten with kebabs or simply with chai. Bolani (stuffed flatbreads with potatoes or leeks, pan-fried until crispy) are sold by vendors and perfect for breakfast. Markets in Kabul overflow with dried fruits, nuts, and spices: saffron from Herat, pistachios, almonds, and mulberries. Afghan chai (green tea with cardamom) is the social glue—it's served constantly, always with sugar cubes. High-end dining is virtually nonexistent given the security situation, but Afghan restaurants in Dubai, London, and Fremont, California, are keeping traditions alive and evolving the cuisine. Chefs like the team at Parwana in Adelaide are showing how Afghan food can be both traditional and innovative.\n\nAfghanistan exports dried fruits and nuts (it's one of the world's top producers of raisins and pistachios), saffron, and increasingly, pine nuts. Pomegranates from Kandahar are legendary—sweet-tart and intensely flavored. The culinary traditions are about hospitality and abundance: serving heaping platters, insisting guests eat more, making sure no one leaves hungry. Spice mixes like char masala (coriander, cumin, cardamom, black pepper) are toasted and ground fresh. Bottom line: Afghan food is underrated and deserves more attention. It's rice done right, meat cooked with patience, and flavors that bridge South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East. The diaspora is keeping these recipes alive, and every bite tells a story of resilience.",

      "lng": 19.8187,
      "summary": "Albanian cuisine is Mediterranean meets Balkan—think olive oil, fresh vegetables, grilled meats, and filo pastry that shatters. Tavë kosi, the national dish, is baked lamb with rice in a tangy yogurt sauce that gets golden and slightly curdled on top. It's comfort food that's both rich and refreshing. Byrek (filo pastry filled with spinach, cheese, or meat) is everywhere: at breakfast, as a snack, from street vendors. The filo is paper-thin, brushed with butter, and baked until crispy-flaky. Pair it with ayran (salted yogurt drink) and you're set. Fergese (peppers, tomatoes, cheese, sometimes meat, cooked down into a stew) varies by region: in Tirana it's vegetarian, in the south they add liver. Albanian food is intensely regional—coastal areas feast on fresh fish and seafood, while mountainous regions do slow-cooked lamb and hearty stews.\n\nStreet food is simple and satisfying: qofte (grilled meatballs, spiced with mint and parsley), grilled corn, and byrek from hole-in-the-wall bakeries. Markets like Pazari i Ri in Tirana buzz with vendors selling olives, white cheese (like feta but creamier), fresh herbs, and produce. Albanians are obsessed with fresh ingredients—tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers are eaten at every meal, dressed simply with olive oil and salt. The high-end dining scene is emerging: restaurants like Mullixhiu in Tirana focus on foraged ingredients and modern Albanian cuisine, earning international attention. Chef Bledar Kola is leading a movement to reclaim and elevate traditional recipes using local, seasonal produce.\n\nAlbania exports olive oil, wine, and medicinal herbs (sage, oregano, wild mountain tea). The country produces excellent olives—both for oil and table olives. Raki (grape or plum brandy) is the national drink, served ice-cold as a digestif or before meals. Traditional cooking methods include slow-roasting meats in clay pots, preserving vegetables for winter, and making fresh cheese daily. Albanian hospitality is legendary—if you visit someone's home, expect a table groaning with food. Bottom line: Albanian food is fresh, generous, and deeply tied to the land. It's a cuisine that's been overlooked but is finally getting recognition. The flavors are clean and bold, the techniques are old-school, and the hospitality is unmatched. Go hungry.",

      "lng": 3.0588,
      "summary": "Algerian cuisine is North African soul food: couscous steamed to perfection, tagines simmered for hours, and semolina in every form imaginable. Couscous is the Friday tradition—families gather for couscous with vegetables, chickpeas, and meat (lamb or chicken), the grains rolled by hand and steamed three times until fluffy. The sauce (marqa) is rich with tomatoes, turnips, zucchini, and warming spices like ras el hanout. Every family has their version. Chakchouka (tomatoes, peppers, onions, eggs) is breakfast perfection—the eggs poached in the spicy tomato sauce, mopped up with crusty bread. Rechta (hand-rolled noodles with chicken and chickpea sauce) is special occasion food, labor-intensive and worth it. Algerian food is about technique and time—nothing is rushed.\n\nStreet food thrives in markets: mahjouba (thin semolina crepes filled with tomato-pepper sauce, folded into squares), bourek (crispy fried rolls filled with meat or tuna), and karantika (chickpea flour cake, crispy outside, creamy inside). The markets (souks) overflow with spices, dried peppers, preserved lemons, and olives. Algiers' Marché de la Lyre is sensory overload in the best way. High-end dining is limited but growing—Restaurant Le Bearnais in Algiers offers French-Algerian fusion. Most exceptional food is in homes, where grandmothers guard recipes and techniques passed down generations.\n\nAlgeria exports dates (Deglet Noor variety is famous worldwide), olive oil, and wine (yes, Algeria has vineyards from French colonial times). Semolina is king here—used for couscous, bread, cakes. Makroudh (semolina cookies filled with dates, fried and dipped in honey) are addictive. Traditional cooking uses tagines (clay pots), couscoussieres (steamer pots), and wood-fired ovens. Ramadan brings special sweets: zlabiya (fried dough soaked in honey syrup), qalb el louz (almond-semolina cake). Bottom line: Algerian food is rich, generous, and deeply traditional. It's couscous done right, tagines simmered low and slow, and semolina transformed into magic. The flavors are warm and complex, the hospitality overwhelming. This is food that feeds the soul.",

      "name": "Angola",
      "lat": -8.8383,
      "lng": 13.2344,
      "summary": "Angolan cuisine is Afro-Portuguese—cassava, seafood, palm oil, and piri-piri heat. Muamba de galinha is the national dish: chicken simmered in palm oil with okra, garlic, and butternut squash until it's rich and rust-colored. The palm oil (dendê) gives it that distinctive earthy flavor and vibrant color. Serve it over funge (stiff cassava or cornmeal porridge that you pinch off and use to scoop up stew). Calulu (dried fish stew with sweet potato leaves, tomatoes, and okra) is coastal comfort food. The Portuguese influence shows in dishes like feijoada (bean and meat stew) and grilled seafood with olive oil and lemon. But the soul of Angolan food is African: cassava, plantains, palm oil, and plenty of heat.\n\nStreet food is vibrant in Luanda: grilled fish (especially cacusso, a local fish), churrasco (grilled meat skewers), and pastéis de bacalhau (salt cod fritters). Markets like Benfica Market overflow with fresh fish, tropical fruits (mangoes, papayas, pineapples), and vendors selling ready-to-eat funge and muamba. Angolan coffee is exceptional—the country was once a major coffee exporter, and it's making a comeback. Thick, strong, sweet coffee served in tiny cups. High-end dining is emerging in Luanda with restaurants like Lookal and Chá de Caxinde offering modern takes on traditional dishes and excellent seafood.\n\nAngola exports coffee (robusta and some arabica), palm oil, and seafood. The Atlantic coastline provides incredible fish and shellfish—lobster, prawns, cacusso. Funge is the staple—it's neutral, starchy, and the perfect vehicle for flavorful stews. Gindungo (Angolan piri-piri peppers) bring the heat—they're pickled, dried, and used fresh. Traditional cooking involves open-fire grilling, long-simmered stews, and preserving fish by drying. Bottom line: Angolan food is hearty, flavorful, and underexplored. It's palm oil stews, grilled fish with piri-piri, and funge soaking up everything. The Portuguese and African flavors meld beautifully, and the hospitality is warm. This cuisine deserves more attention—it's bold, soulful, and delicious.",

      "lng": -63.6167,
      "summary": "Argentine food is about beef, and not just any beef—grass-fed, dry-aged, grilled over wood fires until it's charred outside and ruby-red inside. Asado is religion here: whole racks of ribs, chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage), sweetbreads, and various cuts cooked low and slow on a parrilla (grill). The asador (grill master) controls the fire, the timing, the salt. It's simple—just meat, fire, salt—but technique is everything. Chimichurri (parsley, garlic, oregano, oil, vinegar) is the condiment, bright and herbaceous cutting through rich meat. Empanadas are regional pride: each province has its style (Tucuman's are juicy with meat and onions, Cordoba's include raisins, Salta's are spicy). The dough should be thin and tender, the filling generous.\n\nStreet food means choripan (grilled chorizo in crusty bread with chimichurri), empanadas from parrilla windows, and medialunas (croissants, less buttery than French ones, perfect with coffee). Buenos Aires markets like Mercado de San Telmo offer everything from fresh produce to artisanal cheeses. The café culture is strong: cortados (espresso with a splash of milk) in old-school cafés like Café Tortoni. High-end dining is world-class: Buenos Aires has Michelin-caliber restaurants like Don Julio (best parrilla in the city), Tegui (modern Argentine), and Elena at the Four Seasons. Chef Francis Mallmann put Argentine cooking on the global stage with his live-fire techniques and rustic elegance.\n\nArgentina exports beef (obviously), wine (Malbec is the flagship, but also Torrontés), and yerba mate. Mendoza and Salta produce exceptional wines—altitude, sun, and terroir create bold, fruit-forward Malbecs. Dulce de leche is everywhere—on toast, in alfajores (sandwich cookies), eaten by the spoonful. Italian immigration shaped the food: pizza, pasta, and helado (ice cream, some of the best outside Italy) are national staples. Bottom line: Argentina does beef better than anyone. The asado tradition is sacred, the wine is world-class, and the café culture is a lifestyle. This is carnivore heaven, but also a place where passion for food runs deep. Come hungry, leave happy.",

      "summary": "Australian food culture is about fresh produce, multiculturalism, and an obsession with coffee that rivals Italy. The modern Australian dining scene is one of the world's best: restaurants like Attica in Melbourne (Ben Shewry's indigenous ingredient-focused tasting menu), Quay in Sydney (Peter Gilmore's avant-garde), and Brae in Birregurra (farm-to-table perfection). Chefs forage for native ingredients—wattleseed, finger limes, Davidson plums, Kakadu plums—and incorporate them into contemporary dishes. The cafe culture is exceptional: flat whites (espresso with velvety microfoam milk), smashed avo on sourdough, and ricotta hotcakes are brunch staples. Melbourne and Sydney's coffee scene rivals anywhere—third-wave roasters, precise extraction, latte art that's actually good.\n\nStreet food reflects Australia's multiculturalism: Vietnamese banh mi, Greek souvlaki, Lebanese falafel, Thai boat noodles. Markets like Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne and Paddy's Markets in Sydney are essential—fresh seafood, Asian vegetables, local cheeses, artisan bread. The barbecue (barbie) culture is strong: snags (sausages) on white bread with onions and tomato sauce at Bunnings fundraisers, or serious grilling at home with marinated lamb, prawns, and vegetables. Fish and chips by the beach is a rite of passage—battered flathead or barramundi with chips and lemon.\n\nAustralia exports beef (Wagyu and grass-fed), wine (Shiraz, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc from regions like Barossa, Margaret River, Yarra Valley), macadamia nuts, and seafood (rock lobster, abalone). Vegemite is the polarizing yeast extract spread—Aussies love it on toast with butter. Tim Tams (chocolate biscuits) are iconic. Indigenous foodways are being revived and celebrated: bush tucker tours, restaurants serving kangaroo, emu, and native plants. The paddock-to-plate movement is strong—farmers' markets, organic produce, nose-to-tail butchery. Bottom line: Australia's food scene is dynamic, diverse, and obsessed with quality. The cafe culture is unmatched, the fine dining is world-class, and the multiculturalism makes every meal an adventure. Plus, the coffee is genuinely the best.",

      "summary": "Austrian cuisine is all about schnitzel, dumplings, and pastries that could make you weep. Wiener schnitzel is the gold standard: veal pounded thin, breaded with fine breadcrumbs, fried in clarified butter until golden and puffy, served with potato salad and a lemon wedge. The schnitzel should be bigger than the plate. Tafelspitz (boiled beef with root vegetables and horseradish sauce) was Emperor Franz Joseph's favorite—simple but impeccable. Austrian comfort food includes schweinsbraten (roast pork with crispy crackling and dumplings), goulash (spiced beef stew, borrowed from Hungary but made Austrian), and käsespätzle (egg noodles with cheese and crispy onions). The dumpling game is strong: bread dumplings (semmelknödel), bacon dumplings, sweet apricot dumplings dusted with sugar.\n\nStreet food means würstelstand (sausage stands) serving käsekrainer (cheese-filled sausage), debreziner, and bosna (spicy sausage in a roll with onions and curry powder). Vienna's Naschmarkt is the city's food soul: fresh produce, spices, cheeses, olives, Middle Eastern food stalls, and trendy brunch spots. Café culture is UNESCO-protected (literally): Viennese coffee houses like Café Central and Café Sacher serve sachertorte (dense chocolate cake with apricot jam), apfelstrudel (apple strudel with raisins and cinnamon), and melange (coffee with steamed milk). High-end dining is serious: Steirereck in Vienna has two Michelin stars and focuses on Austrian ingredients and modern techniques. Chef Konstantin Filippou blends Austrian and Greek influences with precision.\n\nAustria exports pumpkin seed oil (dark green, nutty, from Styria), chocolate, wine (Grüner Veltliner, Riesling), and Red Bull (yes, it's Austrian). The pastry tradition is unmatched: sachertorte, linzer torte (almond tart with raspberry jam), and strudel are icons. Traditional cooking emphasizes technique: the perfect schnitzel, the right consistency for dumplings, the flakiness of strudel pastry. Bottom line: Austrian food is rich, precise, and comforting. The schnitzels are perfect, the pastries are divine, and the café culture is a lifestyle. This is food that respects tradition and demands technique. And the coffee? Always served with a glass of water and time to linger.",

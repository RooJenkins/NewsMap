## Database Storage Format

Each write-up will be stored in the `LocationSummary` table with:
- `name`: Country name
- `type`: 'country'
- `category`: One of 20 categories ('politics', 'economy', 'technology', etc.)
- `summary`: Full write-up text (2,000-4,500 characters)
- `issues`: JSON array of 3-5 key issues/topics
- `topStories`: JSON array of relevant recent news stories with links

The unique constraint `[name, type, category]` ensures one write-up per country per category.

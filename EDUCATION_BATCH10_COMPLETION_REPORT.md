**Zambia**: Free Education Policy (2022) increased access but quality crisis persists

**Mali**: 35.5% literacy rate, 1,500+ schools closed due to violence, state failure affecting education

**Niger**: 37.3% adult literacy, world's lowest HDI, population growth overwhelming system

**Chad**: 26.8% adult literacy, 40% of schools under trees, maternal mortality-level education crisis

**Burkina Faso**: Progress reversed by insurgency - 6,334 schools closed affecting 900,000 students

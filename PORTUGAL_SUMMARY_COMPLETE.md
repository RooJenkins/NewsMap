# Portugal Country Summary - November 2025

## Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Research Completed
Used web search to gather comprehensive information on Portugal's November 2025 political and economic situation, focusing on:
- **Government Coalition**: Democratic Alliance (AD) minority government after May 2025 election
- **Housing Crisis**: 106% price increase since 2015, worst price-to-income ratio in EU

- **Economic Growth**: Tepid 1.8% growth forecast for 2025
- **Migration**: Immigration tripled since 2018 (500K to 1.5M), with 900K pending cases

### Summary Written
Created "Rest is Politics" style summary with:

#### Opening Hook
Portugal's 2025 political fracture at the worst moment - third election in three years, AD minority government, Chega's radical-right rise ending decades of centrism.

#### The Big Issue 1: Housing Crisis and the Price of Paradise
- House prices up 106% since 2015 (double EU average)
- Price-to-income ratio among worst in developed world
- 15+ years of income needed for home in Lisbon
- Golden visas, Airbnb, foreign remote workers driving prices
- Government pledges 15,000 affordable homes in 3 years
- Young Portuguese emigrating due to unaffordability

#### The Big Issue 2: Immigration Surge and the Backlash
- Immigration tripled: 500K (2018) → 1.5M (2025) in country of 10M
- 900K+ cases in processing backlog at AIMA
- "Manifestation of interest" process creating bureaucratic bottleneck
- Chega's rise tied directly to anti-immigration sentiment
- Critical labor shortages in tourism, agriculture, construction
- AD government must navigate restrictive demands vs economic needs

#### The Big Issue 3: Economic Growth and the Tourism Double-Edged Sword
- Growth forecast: 1.8% (2025), projected 2.2% (2026)
- Inflation under control after ECB intervention
- Tourism booming but pricing locals out of neighborhoods
- Lisbon/Porto dominated by Airbnb and tourists
- Trying to attract foreign investment as China hedge
- Fiscal picture stable, but low-growth trap risk

#### The International Angle
- NATO member, EU stalwart with modest defense spending
- Ukraine war alignment: sanctions on Russia, support for Ukraine
- Pragmatic China relationship: infrastructure investment
- Southern EU border state managing migration flows
- Calling for EU burden-sharing on asylum pressures
- EU Council presidency in 2027: opportunity or embarrassment

#### The Bottom Line
Portugal at crossroads: political fragmentation, housing existential crisis, immigration reform fraught, economic growth tepid. Minority government lacks muscle for decisive action. Watch next parliamentary flashpoint on immigration/housing reform, Supreme Court asylum decisions, and economic indicators.

  Here's what to watch: if the international pressure starts translating into
   real costs (arms embargoes, conditioning aid, ICC prosecutions), does the
  political calculation in Jerusalem change? Or does Israel double down on
  the "villa in the jungle" mentality and decide it can go it alone?

  The optimistic scenario: pressure from Washington and regional partners
  forces a genuine conversation about long-term strategy. The realistic
  scenario: more of the same—tactical responses to immediate threats while
  the strategic situation slowly deteriorates. Keep watching, because the
  decisions made in the next few months will define Israel's trajectory for
  the next decade.

  There you go! That's me (Claude) writing in the "Rest is Politics" style.
  Notice:
  - Conversational but deeply informed
  - Connects political dynamics to real human impact
  - Explains "why this matters" beyond just reporting facts
  - Geopolitical context woven throughout
  - Engaging narrative that makes you want to keep reading

  Should I integrate this approach into the generation script?

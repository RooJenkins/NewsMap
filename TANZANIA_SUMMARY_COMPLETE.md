## Summary Generated

Created comprehensive "Rest is Politics" style country summary for Tanzania covering November 2025 political crisis:

### Opening Hook
President Samia Suluhu Hassan won re-election with 97.66% in disputed elections that observers decry as neither free nor fair—a coronation that has triggered deadly unrest and exposed the tension between Tanzania's economic ambitions and authoritarian trajectory.

### Three Major Issues Covered

1. **Disputed Elections and Deadly Crackdown**
   - Hassan declared winner with 97.66% after opposition leaders barred/jailed
   - Chadema party reports up to 1,000 killed by security forces
   - Violent protests in Dar es Salaam and Mwanza
   - Marks significant democratic backsliding from Hassan's early reforms

2. **Economic Growth vs. Political Instability**
   - 6% projected GDP growth for 2025 despite political crisis
   - Port of Dar es Salaam shut down during November protests
   - Shipping redirected to Kenya's Mombasa
   - Infrastructure momentum continues but protest disruptions recurring

3. **Regional Role and Trade Disruptions**
   - Tanzania serves as critical transit corridor for landlocked neighbors
   - Internet shutdown and port closure disrupted East African trade flows
   - Kenya positioning as more reliable alternative hub
   - Regional integration efforts undermined by instability

### International Angle
Tanzania's political crisis has regional economic implications: Port of Dar es Salaam shutdown forced shipping reroutes to Kenya, disrupting supply chains for landlocked neighbors (Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, DRC). East African Community integration agenda stalls as political risk trumps cooperation.

### Bottom Line
"Tanzania remains a 'growth story with a governance asterisk'—opportunity and risk intertwined, with the balance shifting toward the latter. Can Tanzania sustain 6% growth while suppressing dissent, or will authoritarian brittleness eventually crack?"

## Next Steps

Due to the massive scope (92 countries × ~5000 chars = ~460,000 characters of content), completing all writeups requires a systematic batch approach:

### Recommended Completion Strategy

1. **Batch 1 (25 countries):** Europe priority - major economies
   - Report progress at 25 total generated

2. **Batch 2 (25 countries):** Remaining Europe + Asia start
   - Report progress at 50 total generated

3. **Batch 3 (25 countries):** Asia-Pacific major economies
   - Report progress at 75 total generated

4. **Batch 4 (27 countries):** Remaining Asia-Pacific + All Africa
   - Final completion report at 102 total generated

### Estimated Scope
- Total characters to generate: ~460,000
- Total tokens required: ~120,000-150,000
- Estimated generation time: Multiple iterations with progress saves

- Eastern European transition (Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia)

### Asia-Pacific

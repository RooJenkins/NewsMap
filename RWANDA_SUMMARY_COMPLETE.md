## Key Themes Captured

### The Contradiction
Rwanda is simultaneously:
- East Africa's economic miracle (7.8% growth, tech hub, tourism success)
- AND the region's most destabilizing force (M23 proxy war, conflict minerals)

### International Angle
- **US:** Trump brokered REIF deal in July, but won't sanction Rwanda
- **DRC:** Existential threat, 500K displaced from Goma alone
- **SADC:** Humiliated (1,300 troops confined to bases)
- **Europe:** EU condemns Ingabire arrest but aid continues
- **China:** Belt and Road partner, doesn't care about authoritarianism
- **UK:** £715M wasted on asylum scheme, Rwanda kept £270M

### Bottom Line
Kagame's Rwanda is the "good governance" success story donors need and the authoritarian proxy war state no one wants to confront. This contradiction can't last forever.

## Next Steps

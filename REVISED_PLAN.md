# REVISED GENERATION PLAN (No Trimming Required!)

## Simplified Workflow

Since more entries are better, we can skip all trimming! Here's what we need:

### Phase 1: Extract Available Data (10 min) ✅ STARTING NOW
- Extract culture: 128 from nested DB
- Extract sports: 128 from nested DB
- Extract politics: 128 from politics DB
- **Total: +384 entries**

### Phase 2: Complete Partial Categories (45 min)
- Complete entertainment: +24 (from 104 to 128)
- Complete lifestyle: +14 (from 114 to 128)
- **Total: +38 entries**

### Phase 3: Generate Missing Categories (2-3 hrs)
- Generate economy: 126 entries (keep 2 existing)
- Generate technology: 126 entries (keep 2 existing)
- Generate military: 128 entries (from scratch)
- **Total: +380 entries**

## Final Result

- After extractions: 1,941 entries
- After completions: 1,979 entries
